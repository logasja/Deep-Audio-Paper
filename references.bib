	abstract = {The auditory system encodes sound by decomposing the amplitude signal arriving at the ear into multiple frequency bands whose center frequencies and bandwidths are approximately exponential functions of the distance from the stapes. This organization is thought to result from the adaptation of cochlear mechanisms to the animal's auditory environment. Here we report that several basic auditory nerve fiber tuning properties can be accounted for by adapting a population of filter shapes to encode natural sounds efficiently. The form of the code depends on sound class, resembling a Fourier transformation when optimized for animal vocalizations and a wavelet transformation when optimized for non-biological environmental sounds. Only for the combined set does the optimal code follow scaling characteristics of physiological data. These results suggest that auditory nerve fibers encode a broad set of natural sounds in a manner consistent with information theoretic principles.},

	doi = {10.1109/TSA.2002.800560},
	abstract = {Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61\% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.},

	abstract = {The vector representations of fixed dimensionality for words (in text) offered by Word2Vec have been shown to be very useful in many application scenarios, in particular due to the semantic information they carry. This paper proposes a parallel version, the Audio Word2Vec. It offers the vector representations of fixed dimensionality for variable-length audio segments. These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with very attractive real world applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection (STD). In this STD application, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the conventional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based approaches at significantly lower computation requirements. We propose unsupervised learning of Audio Word2Vec from audio data without human annotation using Sequence-to-sequence Audoencoder (SA). SA consists of two RNNs equipped with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units: the first RNN (encoder) maps the input audio sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second RNN (decoder) maps the representation back to the input audio sequence. The two RNNs are jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (DSA) is furthered proposed offering more robust learning.},

It would be preferable if our devices were able to attain context awareness without human intervention. One important aspect of user context is environment. We present a novel method for classifying environment types based on acoustic signals. This method makes use of linear autoencoding neural networks, and is motivated by the observation that biological coding systems seem to be heavily influenced by the statistics of their environments. We show that the autoencoder method achieved a lower error rate than a standard Gaussian mixture model on a representative sample task, and that a linear combination of autoencoders and GMMs yielded better performance than either alone.},

In this paper, three structure patterns, including energy envelope pattern, sub-band spectral shape pattern and harmonicity prominence pattern, are proposed or refined, as successive development of our previous work.

Preliminary experimental results suggest that the listener's ability to identify messages in a multi-talker environment significantly improves by enhancing a monophonic signal with the proposed scheme.},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

	abstract = {A key problem in using the output of an auditory model as the input to a machine-learning system in a machine-hearing application is to find a good feature-extraction layer. For systems such as PAMIR (passive-aggressive model for image retrieval) that work well with a large sparse feature vector, a conversion from auditory images to sparse features is needed. For audio-file ranking and retrieval from text queries, based on stabilized auditory images, we took a multi-scale approach, using vector quantization to choose one sparse feature in each of many overlapping regions of different scales, with the hope that in some regions the features for a sound would be stable even when other interfering sounds were present and affecting other regions. We recently extended our testing of this approach using sound mixtures, and found that the sparse-coded auditory-image features degrade less in interference than vector-quantized MFCC sparse features do. This initial success suggests that our hope of robustness in interference may indeed be realizable, via the general idea of sparse features that are localized in a domain where signal components tend to be localized or stable.},

Despite inclusive urban policy aiming to create a balanced distribution of social classes throughout the city and the prioritization of pro-poor housing options from 1900-mid 1950s, Argentina has been experiencing polarizing tendencies since the 1960s, these becoming more acute in the 1980s and 90s. As a result, residential segregation in the city has increased and a housing shortage has persisted. In response to this situation, the state's general housing policy response throughout Argentina has focused on the construction of public housing complexes, which has contributed to the poor's urban isolation by concentrating poverty in undesirable neighborhoods. Lessons on more inclusive housing options can be taken from the United States, and select European and Latin American countries, but desegregation policies are extremely immature throughout the world. This investigation constitutes a state of the art study, in which extensive research was conducted to reconstruct current and historical housing and urban policy in Buenos Aires, in order to provide a stepping stone for more empirical work on this topic in the region.},

We also develop and release a framework able to now-cast housing prices from Open data, without the need for historical transactions. Experiments involving 70,000 houses in 8 Italian cities highlight that the neighborhood's vitality and walkability seem to drive more than 20\% of the housing value. Moreover, the use of this information improves the nowcast by 60\%. Hence, the use of property's surroundings' characteristics can be an invaluable resource to appraise the economic and social value of houses after neighborhood changes and, potentially, anticipate gentrification.},

	abstract = {The real estate market is exposed to many Ô¨Çuctuations in prices because of existing correlations with many variables, some of which cannot be controlled or might even be unknown. Housing prices can increase rapidly (or in some cases, also drop very fast), yet the numerous listings available online where houses are sold or rented are not likely to be updated that often. In some cases, individuals interested in selling a house (or apartment) might include it in some online listing, and forget about updating the price. In other cases, some individuals might be interested in deliberately setting a price below the market price in order to sell the home faster, for various reasons. In this paper, we aim at developing a machine learning application that identiÔ¨Åes opportunities in the real estate market in real time, i.e., houses that are listed with a price substantially below the market price. This program can be useful for investors interested in the housing market. We have focused in a use case considering real estate assets located in the Salamanca district in Madrid (Spain) and listed in the most relevant Spanish online site for home sales and rentals. The application is formally implemented as a regression problem that tries to estimate the market price of a house given features retrieved from public online listings. For building this application, we have performed a feature engineering stage in order to discover relevant features that allows for attaining a high predictive performance. Several machine learning algorithms have been tested, including regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and neural networks, identifying advantages and handicaps of each of them.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges that geographers and urban planners face when thinking about mobility in Latin American cities is how to accurately assess the eÔ¨Äect produced by severe social and territorial inequality. In an attempt to explore this question, this article analyses three key issues related to the inequality-mobility relationship: a) mobility as a facilitator in the access to goods, services and opportunities at diÔ¨Äerent urban scales, and its direct eÔ¨Äects on poverty and social exclusion; b) socially and territorially conditioned assets and competences among individuals when managing mobility needs and territorial control; and c) the uneven appropriation and use of the city, both in terms of proximity and connection to metropolitan networks. Analysis is carried out on secondary information on transport and mobility at the metropolitan scale according to income level and territorial location of households. This is followed by examination of three speciÔ¨Åc cases in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region that show the importance of territorial features when addressing mobility patterns of particular socioeconomically vulnerable groups, including: mobility of informal settlers in urban peripheries; mobility of domestic workers in gated communities; and mobility of residents at risk of displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods. The key Ô¨Åndings highlight how the particular territorial conditions can intensify or attenuate the pre-existing socioeconomic inequality.},

Empirical results consistently demonstrate that expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate the subsequent home price growth, while restrictive monetary policy tends to decelerate the subsequent home price growth. These results suggest that Chinese monetary policy actions are the key driving forces behind the change of real estate price growth in China. We also show that hot money Ô¨Çow does not have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the change of home price growth after controlling for the money supply growth. Finally, a bullish stock market tends to accelerate subsequent home price growth.},

By balancing the pros and cons of using typical hedonic frameworks versus urban forest inventory and management software systems, we (1) construct a data-driven approach to estimate the total amenity value associated with access to, views of, and existence of a particular forest landscape from among all available forest sites in a community and (2) develop a framework for an amenity value calculator for numerous community forest landscapes within a metropolitan county, using the amenity values generated from objective (1), that can be accessed and understood by anyone who is interested in the beneÔ¨Åts provided by nearby community forests. Our research suggests that (i) residential household‚Äôs amenity value per acre of forest landscape decreases asymptotically towards zero as the driving time from a residential house increases, (ii) an amenity value calculator can be developed to sum the amenity values across all detached single-family houses within a range of driving times from any selected forest landscape, and (iii) a user-friendly, web-based application, that allows users to view the estimated amenity values of forest landscapes that interest them, can be created to better inform the public about the values of forest landscapes of interest to them.},

By integrating open data from Lianjia.com, Dianping.com, Mobike.com, and Baidu Map POI, we analyze spatial patterns of apartment prices and their association with local attributes in Shanghai. We Ô¨Ånd that Shanghai's residential market still has a monocentric structure because of the centralized distribution of public transport facilities and amenities. Hedonic models further conÔ¨Årm that structural attributes, accessibility, as well as public and private service amenities signiÔ¨Åcantly shape the real estate market. These factors also are diÔ¨Äerentiated so as to form a pattern of concentric rings. In the inner-city and expanded inner-city areas, public service amenities such as parks, schools, hospitals, and banks, as well as private service amenities such as entertainment, shopping, and residential service facilities, boost housing prices. In the suburbs, better access to bike sharing, bus stops, and metro stations are the top preferences for apartment buyers. Our study also indicates that the Chinese government needs to make public and private services more accessible, not only spatially in urban peripheries and villages, but also institutionally to lower income families who cannot aÔ¨Äord apartments in expensive neighborhoods.},

We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for the topic model, and introduce the notion of acoustic words for supporting modeling within this framework. In audio description classification tasks using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the BBC database, the proposed acoustic topic model shows promising results by outperforming the Latent Perceptual Indexing (LPI) method in classifying onomatopoeia descriptions and semantic descriptions.},

	abstract = {The two Cono Sur capitals share similarities (effects of globalization, socio-spatial segregation, fragmentation, rise of gated cities, social housing in remote locations lacking public transport), however a variety of differences can be observed. Whereas in Santiago gated communities are widespread in the urban fabric, in Buenos Aires these communities are concentrated only in the north and northwestern parts of the city. In Chile parcelas de agrado with more than 5000 m¬≤ fulfill the demand of upper class citizens for more space for luxury villas. Ethnic segregation is seen as a problem in Santiago, where Peruvian immigrants occupy some sectors of the city centre, whereas in Buenos Aires most immigrants are coming from non-metropolitan regions of Argentina. Last not least gentrification in quite strong in Santiago‚Äôs central communes, whereas the Argentines in a quite unusual way interpret the development of gated communities as a process of social upgrading.},

	abstract = {In vision, humans use summary statistics (e.g., the average facial expression of a crowd) to efficiently perceive the gist of groups of features. Here, we present direct evidence that ensemble coding is also important for auditory processing. We found that listeners could accurately estimate the mean frequency of a set of logarithmically spaced pure tones presented in a temporal sequence (Experiment 1). Their performance was severely reduced when only a subset of tones from a given sequence was presented (Experiment 2), which demonstrates that ensemble coding is based on a substantial number of the tones in a sequence. This precise ensemble coding occurred despite very limited representation of individual tones from the sequence: Listeners were poor at identifying specific individual member tones (Experiment 3) and at determining their positions in the sequence (Experiment 4). Together, these results indicate that summary statistical coding is not limited to visual processing and is an important auditory mechanism for extracting ensemble frequency information from sequences of sounds.},

This is followed by a survey of how speech sounds and elements thereof are represented in the activity patterns along the auditory pathway. Then the evidence for a place representation of texture features of sound, comprising frequency, periodicity pitch, harmonicity in vowels, and direction and speed of frequency modulation, and for a temporal and synchrony representation of sound contours, comprising onsets, offsets, voice onset time, and low rate amplitude modulation, in auditory cortex is reviewed. Contours mark changes and transitions in sound and auditory cortex appears particularly sensitive to these dynamic aspects of sound. Texture determines which neurons, both cortical and subcortical, are activated by the sound whereas the contours modulate the activity of those neurons. Because contours are temporally represented in the majority of neurons activated by the texture aspects of sound, each of these neurons is part of an ensemble formed by the combination of contour and texture sensitivity. A multiplexed coding of complex sound is proposed whereby the contours set up widespread synchrony across those neurons in all auditory cortical areas that are activated by the texture of sound.

Therefore, an unsupervised feature learning method for exploration of audio data is presented in this paper. It incorporates the two following novel contributions: First, an audio frame predictor based on a Convolutional LSTM autoencoder is demonstrated, which is used for unsupervised feature extraction. Second, a training method for autoencoders is presented, which leads to distinct features by amplifying event similarities. In comparison to standard approaches, the features extracted from the audio frame predictor trained with the novel approach show 13 \% better results when used with a classifier and 36 \% better results when used for clustering.},

This paper describes the creation of Audio Set, a large-scale dataset of manually-annotated audio events that endeavors to bridge the gap in data availability between image and audio research. Using a carefully structured hierarchical ontology of 632 audio classes guided by the literature and manual curation, we collect data from human labelers to probe the presence of specific audio classes in 10 second segments of YouTube videos. Segments are proposed for labeling using searches based on metadata, context (e.g., links), and content analysis. The result is a dataset of unprecedented breadth and size that will, we hope, substantially stimulate the de-velopment of high-performance audio event recognizers.},

	abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

We collect a data set of 1700 human-generated annotations that describe 500 Western popular music tracks. For each word in a vocabulary, we use this data to train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) over an audio feature space. We estimate the parameters of the model using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation maximization algorithm. This algorithm is more scalable to large data sets and produces better density estimates than standard parameter estimation techniques. The quality of the music annotations produced by our system is comparable with the performance of humans on the same task. Our " query-by-text " system can retrieve appropriate songs for a large number of musically relevant words. We also show that our audition system is general by learning a model that can annotate and retrieve sound effects.},

	abstract = {Query-by-semantic-description (QBSD)is a natural paradigm for retrieving content from large databases of music. A major impediment to the development of good QBSD systems for music information retrieval has been the lack of a cleanly-labeled, publicly-available, heterogeneous data set of songs and associated annotations. We have collected the Computer Audition Lab 500-song (CAL500) data set by having humans listen to and annotate songs using a survey designed to capture 'semantic associations' between music and words. We adapt the supervised multi-class labeling (SML) model, which has shown good performance on the task of image retrieval, and use the CAL500 data to learn a model for music retrieval. The model parameters are estimated using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation-maximization algorithm which has been specifically designed to handle real-valued semantic association between words and songs, rather than binary class labels. The output of the SML model, a vector of class-conditional probabilities, can be interpreted as a semantic multinomial distribution over a vocabulary. By also representing a semantic query as a query multinomial distribution, we can quickly rank order the songs in a database based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query multinomial and each song's semantic multinomial. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SML model can both annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs given a multi-word, text-based query.},

In this article, I take an ecological approach to everyday listening to overcome constraints on its study implied by more traditional approaches. In particular, I am concerned with deveolping a new framework for describing sound in terms of audible sources attributes. An examination of the coninuum of structured energy from events to audition suggests that sound conveys information about events at locations in an environment. Qualitative descriptions of the physics of sound-producing events into those involving vibrating solids, gasses, or liquids. Within each of these categories, basic-level events are defined by the simple interactions that can cause these materials to sound, whereas more complex events can be descrived in terms of temporal patterning, compound, or hybrid sources. The results of these investigations are used to creat a map of sound-producing events and their attributes useful in guiding furhter exploration.},

Recent digitization efforts in some of the larger animal sound archives bring other types of audio recordings into the focus of interest. Although recordings in animal sound archives are usually very well annotated by metadata, it is almost impossible to manually annotate all sounds made by animals in each recording. Complementary to classical text-based querying of databases that exploit available annotations, algorithms capable of automatically finding sections of recordings similar to a given query fragment provide a promising approach for content-based navigation. In our work, we present algorithms for feature extraction, as well as indexing and retrieval of animal sound recordings. Making use of a concept from image processing, the structure tensor, our feature extraction algorithm is adapted to the typical curve-like spectral features that are characteristic for many types of animal sounds. We propose a method for similarity search in animal sound databases which is obtained by adding a novel ranking scheme to an existing inverted file based approach for multimedia retrieval. Evaluation of our methods is based on recordings from the Animal Sound Archive, Berlin.},

Recent advances in machine learning, as well as in computational models of the human auditory system, have contributed to advances in this increasingly popular research field. Robust sound event classification, the ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, is an especially challenging task. Classification methods translated from the speech recognition domain, using features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, have been shown to perform reasonably well for the sound event classification task, although spectrogram-based or auditory image analysis techniques reportedly achieve superior performance in noise. This paper outlines a sound event classification framework that compares auditory image front end features with spectrogram image-based front end features, using support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers. Performance is evaluated on a standard robust classification task in different levels of corrupting noise, and with several system enhancements, and shown to compare very well with current state-of-the-art classification techniques.},

In this paper, we present DeepEar ‚Äì the first mobile audio sens- ing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sens- ing tasks.

The central idea is to learn a probability distribution over a set of latent topics of a given audio clip in an unsupervised manner, assuming that there exist latent acoustic topics and each audio clip can be described in terms of those latent acoustic topics. In this regard, we use the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to implement the acoustic topic models over elemental acoustic units, referred as acoustic words, and perform text-like audio signal processing. Experiments on audio tag classification with the BBC sound effects library demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed latent audio context modeling schemes. In particular, the proposed method is shown to be superior to other latent structure analysis methods, such as latent semantic analysis and probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We also demonstrate that topic models can be used as complementary features to content-based features and offer about 9\% relative improvement in audio classification when combined with the traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique.},

This content-based approach differs from retrieval approaches that index media files using metadata such as file names and user tags. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for retrieving sounds that is novel in that it (1) uses free-form text queries rather sound sample based queries, (2) searches by audio content rather than via textual meta data, and (3) can scale to very large number of audio documents and very rich query vocabulary. We handle generic sounds, including a wide variety of sound effects, animal vocalizations and natural scenes. We test a scalable approach based on a passive-aggressive model for image retrieval (PAMIR), and compare it to two state-of-the-art approaches; Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and support vector machines (SVM). We test our approach on two large real-world datasets: a collection of short sound effects, and a noisier and larger collection of user-contributed user-labeled recordings (25K files, 2000 terms vocabulary). We find that all three methods achieved very good retrieval performance. For instance, a positive document is retrieved in the first position of the ranking more than half the time, and on average there are more than 4 positive documents in the first 10 retrieved, for both datasets. PAMIR completed both training and retrieval of all data in less than 6 hours for both datasets, on a single machine. It was one to three orders of magnitude faster than the competing approaches. This approach should therefore scale to much larger datasets in the future.},

We present our preliminary efforts towards a wireless wearable system for continuous auscultation of respiratory behavior by recording internal sounds at the neck and chest by means of a commercially available electronic stethoscope to provide objective decision support for handlers. We have identified discrete features of sniffing and panting in the time domain and utilize event duration, event rate, event mean energy, and the number of consecutive events in a row to build a decision tree classifier. Since feature extraction requires segmentation of individual sniffing and panting events, we developed an adaptive method using short-time energy contour and an adaptive threshold.

	abstract = {Design studies that use radiotelemetry require careful consideration of the goals of a project and the resources available to meet those goals. Success in meeting the research goals depends on thoughtful planning of field methods and ancillary data collection, selection of telemetry equipment appropriate to the study animal and budget, careful execution of the field protocols, and creative analysis of the data. Some of the most important design factors include consideration of the study's purpose; degree of experimental manipulation, controls, and replication; selection of an efficient yet unbiased sampling scheme; definition of the sample unit; calculation of sample size requirements; identification and removal of sources of bias; and clear specification of biological significance. This chapter emphasizes the need to integrate univariate metrics of animal choice, such as estimates of home range size and resource selection, with metrics for the demographic consequences of these choices, all of which can be generated from radiotelemetry. Radiotelemetry is an essential tool in modern studies of movement, migration, and dispersal of most vertebrates. Its use has dramatically increased the amount and detail of information available for estimating movements of larger animals, and provides extremely valuable additions to information from studies that use tagging, banding (ringing), and other forms of marking for smaller animals. In addition, radiotelemetry studies are an important complement to recent approaches that use genetic markers.},

Unfortunately, authors do not explicitly take into consideration dog-human differences in visual perception when designing their experiments. With an image manipulation program we altered stationary images, according to the present knowledge about dog-vision. Besides the effect of dogs‚Äô dichromatic vision, the software shows the effect of the lower visual acuity and brightness discrimination, too. Fifty adult humans were tested with pictures showing a female experimenter pointing, gazing or glancing to the left or right side. Half of the pictures were shown after they were altered to a setting that approximated dog vision. Participants had difficulty to find out the direction of glancing when the pictures were in dog-vision mode. Glances in dog-vision setting were followed less correctly and with a slower response time than other cues. Our results are the first that show the visual performance of humans under circumstances that model how dogs‚Äô weaker vision would affect their responses in an ethological experiment. We urge researchers to take into consideration the differences between perceptual abilities of dogs and humans, by developing visual stimuli that fit more appropriately to dogs‚Äô visual capabilities.},

	abstract = {Body size is an important feature that affects fighting ability; however, size-related parameters of agonistic vocalizations are difficult to manipulate because of anatomical constraints within the vocal production system. Rare examples of acoustic size modulation are due to specific features that enable the sender to steadily communicate exaggerated body size. However, one could argue that it would be more adaptive if senders could adjust their signaling behavior to the fighting potential of their actual opponent. So far there has been no experimental evidence for this possibility. We tested this hypothesis by exposing family dogs (Canis familiaris) to humans with potentially different fighting ability. In a within-subject experiment, 64 dogs of various breeds consecutively faced two threateningly approaching humans, either two men or two women of different stature, or a man and a woman of similar or different stature. We found that the dogs‚Äô vocal responses were affected by the gender of the threatening stranger and the dog owner‚Äôs gender. Dogs with a female owner, or those dogs which came from a household where both genders were present, reacted with growls of lower values of the Pitch‚ÄìFormant component (including deeper fundamental frequency and lower formant dispersion) to threatening men. Our results are the first to show that non-human animals react with dynamic alteration of acoustic parameters related to their individual indexical features (body size), depending on the level of threat in an agonistic encounter.},

	abstract = {Barking is perhaps the most characteristic form of vocalization in dogs; however, very little is known about its role in the intraspecific communication of this species. Besides the obvious need for ethological research, both in the field and in the laboratory, the possible information content of barks can also be explored by computerized acoustic analyses. This study compares four different supervised learning methods (naive Bayes, classification trees, [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors and logistic regression) combined with three strategies for selecting variables (all variables, filter and wrapper feature subset selections) to classify Mudi dogs by sex, age, context and individual from their barks. The classification accuracy of the models obtained was estimated by means of [Formula: see text]-fold cross-validation. Percentages of correct classifications were 85.13 \% for determining sex, 80.25 \% for predicting age (recodified as young, adult and old), 55.50 \% for classifying contexts (seven situations) and 67.63 \% for recognizing individuals (8 dogs), so the results are encouraging. The best-performing method was [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors following a wrapper feature selection approach. The results for classifying contexts and recognizing individual dogs were better with this method than they were for other approaches reported in the specialized literature. This is the first time that the sex and age of domestic dogs have been predicted with the help of sound analysis. This study shows that dog barks carry ample information regarding the caller's indexical features. Our computerized analysis provides indirect proof that barks may serve as an important source of information for dogs as well.},

Humans use these structural rules to attribute emotions to dog vocalizations, especially to barks, which match with their contexts. In contrast, humans were found to be unable to differentiate between playful and threatening growls, probably because single growls‚Äô aggression level was assessed based on acoustic size cues. To resolve this contradiction, we played back natural growl bouts from three social contexts (food guarding, threatening and playing) to humans, who had to rate the emotional load and guess the context of the playbacks. Listeners attributed emotions to growls according to their social contexts. Within threatening and playful contexts, bouts with shorter, slower pulsing growls and showing smaller apparent body size were rated to be less aggressive and fearful, but more playful and happy. Participants associated the correct contexts with the growls above chance. Moreover, women and participants experienced with dogs scored higher in this task. Our results indicate that dogs may communicate honestly their size and inner state in a serious contest situation, while manipulatively in more uncertain defensive and playful contexts.},

The olfactory experience of an untrained dog, by contrast, has not been well documented. In the current research we begin to remedy that by testing untrained pet dogs' olfactory perception of quantity. While previous research found that dogs could discriminate visible quantities of more or less food (Prato-Previde, Marshall-Pescini, \& Valsecchi, 2008), our results find that, by contrast, companion dogs do not reliably discriminate quantities when the food can be smelled but not seen. Sixty-one percent of dogs (39 of 64), given a choice between closed plates with one and five morsels of food, approached plates with the larger quantity: not significantly more than approached plates with the lesser quantity (binomial, p = .169). We did find that during dogs' initial investigation of both food amounts, subjects gave more attention to the plate containing the larger quantity (binomial, p{\textless} 0.001). In a second condition, we replicated, with closed plates, Prato-Previde et al.'s (2008) finding that owner interest in a plate holding a lesser quantity of food reliably leads dogs to approach that plate (binomial, p{\textless} 0.001). Though research has demonstrated dogs' preference for a larger amount of food (Ward \& Smuts, 2007), in a third condition testing the effect of adding a strong odor to a visibly larger food quantity, we found that the addition of odor often reversed that preference (44/69 dogs; p{\textless} .03). Finally, we consider the methodological implications of this work on future dog cognition studies. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In total, 12,964 calls were classified visually from spectrograms into five voiced (tonal) (whine, moo, cackle, growl and bark), and three unvoiced, or noisy (pant, snort and cough) call types. The classification results were verified with discriminant function analysis (DFA) and randomization. We found that the Aggressive and Unselected foxes produced the same call type sets toward humans, whereas the Tame foxes used distinctive vocalizations toward humans. The Tame and Aggressive foxes had significantly higher percentages of time spent vocalizing than the Unselected, in support of Cohen \& Fox (1976) hypothesis that domestication relaxes the selection pressure for silence, still acting in wild canids. Unlike in dogs, the "domesticated" Tame foxes did not show hypertrophied barking toward humans, using instead the cackle and pant. We conclude that the use of a certain call type for communication between humans and canids is species-specific, and not is the direct effect of domestication per se. ¬¨¬© 2008 AB Academic Publishers.},

Using a cross-modal preferential looking paradigm, we presented dogs with either human or dog faces with different emotional valences (happy/playful versus angry/aggressive) paired with a single vocalization from the same individual with either a positive or negative valence or Brownian noise. Dogs looked significantly longer at the face whose expression was congruent to the valence of vocalization, for both conspecifics and heterospecifics, an ability previously known only in humans.

The dogs did not show any significant evidence of dishabituation to the Control condition of the mechanical noises.

	abstract = {Besides being a widely investigated behavioural phenomenon, barks of dogs often represent a factor of nuisance for people. Although some argue that dog barking has no or only minimal communicative function, it was shown recently that these acoustic signals carry various information that humans can decipher. However, apart from a few laboratory studies, until now no targeted research has been done about the communicative role of barks in the intraspecific domain. In this field experiment companion dogs were tested with bark playbacks at home, in a suburban environment. From a hidden sound system, placed near to the gate outside of the property, each subject was exposed to pre-recorded barks of an unfamiliar and a familiar dog. Barks for the playbacks were recorded in two different contexts: when the dog was either left alone or when it was barking at a stranger at the fence. We found differences in the behaviour of dogs depending on both the familiarity and context of the playback barks. The position of the dogs (near the house or near the gate) was mainly influenced by the context of the barks (p=0.011), in a significant interaction with the familiarity of the barking dog (p=0.020). Subjects stayed at the gate (nearest to the source of the sound) the longest when they heard an unfamiliar dog barking at a stranger (padj=0.012). Meanwhile they stayed at the house mostly during the barks of a lonely unfamiliar dog (padj=0.001). Dogs oriented more towards the house (where the familiar dog stayed during the experiment) when they heard the familiar dog's barking (p=0.019). Subjects barked more often when they heard the ‚Äòstranger‚Äô barks, independently of the familiarity of the caller (p=0.035). As a conclusion, dogs seemingly distinguished among the callers based on familiarity and between the contexts of the barks. This is the first study on companion dogs in their natural environment that found evidence that dogs are able to extract detailed information from the barks.

Prerecorded barks of a Hungarian herding dog breed (Mudi) provided the sample. Human listeners were asked to rate emotionality of the vocalization and to categorize the situations on the basis of alternative situations provided on a questionnaire. The authors found almost no effect of previous experience with the given dog breed or of owning a dog. Listeners were able to categorize bark situations high above chance level. Emotionality ratings for particular bark samples correlated with peak and fundamental frequency and interbark intervals. The authors did not find a significant effect of tonality (harmonic-to-noise ratio) on either the emotionality rating or situation categorization of the human listeners. Humans' ability to recognize meaning suggests that barks could serve as an effective means of communication between dog and human.},

In this review, an ethological look is taken at the communicative aspect of dog barking. Emerging new research has indicated that in the repertoire of dog vocalisations barking has unique features in showing wide ranges of acoustic parameters, such as frequency, tonality and rhythmicity. Barking has been shown to be context dependent, and provides information for humans about the inner state of the dog although there are few indications that barking is used for intra-species communication. It is assumed that dog barking emerged through selective processes in which human preferences for certain acoustic aspects of the vocalisation may have been paramount. A more experiment-oriented approach is required for the study of dog vocalisation that could shed light on the possible communicative function of these acoustic signals.},

We describe two methods developed for the frequency analysis of a complex swift fox Vulpes uelox vocalisation, the barking sequence: (1) autocorrelation function analysis and (2) instantaneous frequency analysis. The autocorrelation function analysis results in an energy density spectrum of the signal's averaged amplitude and frequency information. This analysis was used for locating possible formant structures and quantifying the energy distribution of single barks in the barking sequence. The instantaneous frequency analysis is applied to individual continuous frequency bands and generates frequency contours with a resolution of a couple of Hertz. It was used to quantify frequency modulation and calculate average frequencies of harmonic bands in individual barks and to estimate fundamental frequencies. This second method of analysis had to be evaluated with spectrographic analysis to gauge its reliability for each band analysed. The algorithms used should make both of these methods applicable to other complex vocalisations. Keywords:},

	abstract = {Canine vocalizations can be divided into several types and these types of vocalizations can carry the senders' emotional state to receivers such as other dogs and humans. When humans send a signal consisting of short notes, it can elicit a reactive response and increase motor activity levels more so than a signal consisting of a longer continuous note. This means that humans and dogs can communicate with each other using acoustic signals. These canine vocalizations can be analyzed by computer-aided programs that evaluate several parameters including fundamental frequency, and other frequency variables like minimum and maximum frequency, duration of call, inter-call duration, amplitude variables, harmonic to noise ratio (HNR), nonlinear phenomena, like limit cycle, subharmonic, biphonation, and chaos. Dogs' vocalizations can be analyzed using objective scientific criteria with these parameters, and using this analysis, we know that dog vocalizations fall into several context based vocal types. Also humans can distinguish the difference in dog barks. The dogs' barking can be a behavioral problem because of their high intensity especially in urban areas. Treatment methods may include environmental manipulation, behavior modification, and positive re-enforcement. This paper discusses the literature related to scientific analysis of canine vocalization. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Barking in domestic dogs still remains a topic of controversial discussions. While some authors assess dog- barking an acoustic means of expression becoming more and more sophisticated during domestication, others name this sound type "non-communicative". Vocal repertoires as works on individual sound types are rare, however, and there has been almost no work done on Iow-intensity, close-range vocalizations, yet such types of vocalization are especially important with the more social canids, hence, with the human-dog-communication and understanding of dogs. Most of the investigations published so far are based on auditive sound impressions and lack objectivity. The principal method used in this study was sonagraphic. This facilitates the identiftcation of sounds and reveales, whether subjective Classification can be verified by objectively measured parameters. Finally, meanings, funetions and emotions were examined for all the major sounds described and are discussed in terms of relationships between sound structure and Signal function, signal emission and social context as behavioural response, and overlapping Channels of communication. Ontogeny of acoustic communication in 11 European wolves has been compared to various dog breeds (8 Standard Poodles, 8 Toy Poodles, 15 Kleine M√ºnsterl√§nder, 11 Weimaraner Hunting Dogs, 16 Tervueren, 12 American Staffordshire Terriers, and 13 German Shepherds, 12 Alaskan Malamutes, and 9 Bull Terriers) from birth up to 8 (12) weeks resp. 4 (12) months of age. Noisy and harmonic sound groups were analysed separately as overriding units. Following parameters were used: fmax=maximum of spectrographic pietured sounds (Hz), xfo=mean of the lowest frequency band of harmonic sounds (Hz), xfd=mean of the frequency of strongest amplitude of noisy sounds (Hz), delta f=frequency r√§nge of sounds (Hz), duration of sounds (ms). Statistical analysis was run on "Statistica", Release 4,0. Within the sound type barking 2 to 12 subunits were classified in the different breeds, aecording to their context-speeifie spectrographic design, and behavioural responses. Categories of function / emotion include f.e. social play, play soliticing, exploration, caregiving, social contact and "greeting", loneliness, and agonistc behaviours. "Interaction" was the most common category of social context for masted barkings (56\% of oecurences). Especially close-range vocalizations, conceming the major sound type of most domestic dogs, the bark, evolved highly variable. However, the ecological niche of domestic dogs is highly variable, just as the individual differences in the dogs are, which seem to be breed-typical to a great extent. Thus, complexity within the dog's vocal repertoire, and therefore enhancement of its communicative value, is achieved by many subunits of bark, some standing for specific motivations, informations and expressions. Complexity within the dogs'vocal repertoire is extended by the use of mixed sounds in the barking context. Transitions and gradations to a great extend oeeur via bark sounds: harmonic, intermediate and noisy subunits.},

	abstract = {A number of species are considered to use functionally referential signals such as alarm calls or food-related vocalizations. However, this particular function of communicative interaction has not previously been found in canids. We provide the first experimental indication that domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, rely on context-dependent signals during interspecific agonistic encounters. We recorded several sequences of growls from dogs in three different contexts: during play, guarding a bone from another dog, and reacting to a threatening stranger. We analysed the acoustic structure of the growls and additionally performed playback tests in a seminatural food-guarding situation. We found that play growls differed acoustically from the other two (agonistic) types of growls, mainly in their fundamental frequencies and formant dispersions. Results of the playback experiment showed that food-guarding growls deterred other dogs from taking away a seemingly unattended bone more effectively than growls recorded in the threatening stranger situation. We ruled out an effect of the signaller's body weight on the subjects' responses. These results provide the first evidence of context specificity of agonistic vocalizations in the dog. We discuss the possible aspects of honesty and deception through acoustic modulation of growls. ¬© 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {The computer-aided analysis of acoustic signals of mammals is still a problem, as often (a) sound structures are complex, (b) vocal repertoires often comprise an enormous variety of vocalisations, (c) recordings are influenced by the acoustic conditions of the environment, and (d) the distance and spatial orientation of the sender to the microphone changes. In recent software packages for the analysis of acoustic signals, procedures are integrated which allow the calculation of a variety of signal features. However, these algorithms are often problematic under the conditions mentioned above. In this paper, we present a multi-parametric approach which reduces these problems and which allows a quantitative and reproducible analysis of complex animal vocalisations. Our approach comprises the following aspects: (1) reduction of influences of recording conditions, (2) determination of different sound features and (3) calculation of parameters to characterize these sound features. All calculations are done on the basis of the digitized spectrograms. Special attention is given to the use of smoothing algorithms and dynamic thresholds in order to estimate sound features and to reduce influences resulting from recording conditions. The suitability of our approach has been demonstrated successfully for vocalisations of different species.},

	abstract = {The physical nature of the vocal tract results in the production of formants during vocalisation. In some animals (including humans), receivers can derive information (such as body size) about sender characteristics on the basis of formant characteristics. Domestication and selective breeding have resulted in a high variability in head size and shape in the dog (Canis familiaris), suggesting that there might be large differences in the vocal tract length, which could cause formant behaviour to affect interbreed communication. Lateral radiographs were made of dogs from several breeds ranging in size from a Yorkshire terrier (2.5 kg) to a German shepherd (50 kg) and were used to measure vocal tract length. In addition, we recorded an acoustic signal (growling) from some dogs. Significant correlations were found between vocal tract length, body mass and formant dispersion, suggesting that formant dispersion can deliver information about the body size of the vocalizer. Because of the low correlation between vocal tract length and the first formant, we predict a non-uniform vocal tract shape.},

	abstract = {In this study we sought to determine whether dog barks could be divided into subtypes based on context. We recorded barking from 10 adult dogs, Canis familiaris, of six breeds in three different test situations: (1) a disturbance situation in which a stranger rang the doorbell, (2) an isolation situation in which the dog was locked outside or in a room isolated from its owner and (3) a play situation in which either two dogs or a human and a dog played together. We analysed spectrograms of 4672 barks using macros that took 60 sequential frequency measurements and 60 sequential amplitude measurements along the length of the call. Statistical analyses revealed that barks are graded vocalizations that range from harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated calls to harmonically rich, higher-frequency, modulated calls. The harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated barks were more commonly given in the disturbance situation, and the more tonal, higher-pitch, modulated barks were more commonly given in the isolation and play situations. Disturbance barks were also longer in duration with more rapid repetition than the barks given in other contexts. Discriminant analysis revealed that dog barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context even within individual dogs, and that dogs can be identified by their bark spectrograms despite the context of the bark. ¬© 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

	abstract = {Barking is most often associated with the domestic dog Canis familiaris, but it is a common mammalian and avian vocalization. Like any vocalization, the acoustic character of the bark is likely to be a product of adaptation as well as an expression of the signaler's internal motivational state. While most authors recognize that the bark is a distinct signal type, no consistent description of its acoustic definition or function is apparent. The bark exhibits considerable variability in its acoustic form and occurs in a wide range of behavioral contexts, particularly in dogs. This has led some authors to suggest that dog barking might be a form of referential signaling, or an adaptation for heightened capability to communicate with humans. In this paper we propose a general ‚Äòcanonical‚Äô acoustic description of the bark. Surveying relevant literature on dogs, wild canids, other mammals and birds, we explore an alternative functional hypothesis, first suggested by [Morton, E.S., 1977. On the occurrence and significance of motivation-structural rules in some bird and mammal sounds. Am. Nat. 111, 855‚Äì869] and consistent with his motivational-structural rules theory: that barking in many animals, including the domestic dog, is associated with mobbing behavior and the motivational states that accompany mobbing.},
