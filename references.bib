	abstract = {Current and past housing policy in Buenos Aires has not been effective for the social insertion of the poor, because, by focusing primarily on the provision of housing, it has not attempted to reduce residential segregation and mitigate the consequences of living in a poor neighborhood. Despite inclusive urban policy aiming to create a balanced distribution of social classes throughout the city and the prioritization of pro-poor housing options from 1900-mid 1950s, Argentina has been experiencing polarizing tendencies since the 1960s, these becoming more acute in the 1980s and 90s. As a result, residential segregation in the city has increased and a housing shortage has persisted. In response to this situation, the state's general housing policy response throughout Argentina has focused on the construction of public housing complexes, which has contributed to the poor's urban isolation by concentrating poverty in undesirable neighborhoods. Lessons on more inclusive housing options can be taken from the United States, and select European and Latin American countries, but desegregation policies are extremely immature throughout the world. This investigation constitutes a state of the art study, in which extensive research was conducted to reconstruct current and historical housing and urban policy in Buenos Aires, in order to provide a stepping stone for more empirical work on this topic in the region.},

	abstract = {Housing costs have a significant impact on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Recently, online companies such as Zillow have developed proprietary systems that provide automated estimates of housing prices without the immediate need of professional appraisers. Yet, our understanding of what drives the value of houses is very limited. In this paper, we use multiple sources of data to entangle the economic contribution of the neighborhood's characteristics such as walkability and security perception. We also develop and release a framework able to now-cast housing prices from Open data, without the need for historical transactions. Experiments involving 70,000 houses in 8 Italian cities highlight that the neighborhood's vitality and walkability seem to drive more than 20\% of the housing value. Moreover, the use of this information improves the nowcast by 60\%. Hence, the use of property's surroundings' characteristics can be an invaluable resource to appraise the economic and social value of houses after neighborhood changes and, potentially, anticipate gentrification.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed new residential property values of Xi’an City in March, 2014. Results show that accessibility indices, such as distance to CBD, have been well capitalized into the residential property values. Particularly, a within-zone housing unit is sold 9.4\% more than if it was outside the attendance zone of a Key Primary School, i.e. home buyers have how much willingness-to-pay for the high-quality educational resource. Another corollary is got that the accessibility to subway stations has not significantly been capitalized, only with a low premium reflecting in the real estate market of Xi’an City. Considered that spatial local singularities caused by unobserved variables or estimation bias can be associated with multi-regression errors, this study herein has explored an unconventional viewpoint to residual problem, which combines the regional differences (coming from real world) and the spatial distributions of singularities (feedback from data). Furthermore, whole samples are classified into 5 agglomerations for revealing the underlying reasons about the future trend and variation of real estate market within each region. It is effective to provide scientific basis of decision making for the real estate investors and planners.},

	abstract = {The real estate market is exposed to many ﬂuctuations in prices because of existing correlations with many variables, some of which cannot be controlled or might even be unknown. Housing prices can increase rapidly (or in some cases, also drop very fast), yet the numerous listings available online where houses are sold or rented are not likely to be updated that often. In some cases, individuals interested in selling a house (or apartment) might include it in some online listing, and forget about updating the price. In other cases, some individuals might be interested in deliberately setting a price below the market price in order to sell the home faster, for various reasons. In this paper, we aim at developing a machine learning application that identiﬁes opportunities in the real estate market in real time, i.e., houses that are listed with a price substantially below the market price. This program can be useful for investors interested in the housing market. We have focused in a use case considering real estate assets located in the Salamanca district in Madrid (Spain) and listed in the most relevant Spanish online site for home sales and rentals. The application is formally implemented as a regression problem that tries to estimate the market price of a house given features retrieved from public online listings. For building this application, we have performed a feature engineering stage in order to discover relevant features that allows for attaining a high predictive performance. Several machine learning algorithms have been tested, including regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and neural networks, identifying advantages and handicaps of each of them.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges that geographers and urban planners face when thinking about mobility in Latin American cities is how to accurately assess the eﬀect produced by severe social and territorial inequality. In an attempt to explore this question, this article analyses three key issues related to the inequality-mobility relationship: a) mobility as a facilitator in the access to goods, services and opportunities at diﬀerent urban scales, and its direct eﬀects on poverty and social exclusion; b) socially and territorially conditioned assets and competences among individuals when managing mobility needs and territorial control; and c) the uneven appropriation and use of the city, both in terms of proximity and connection to metropolitan networks. Analysis is carried out on secondary information on transport and mobility at the metropolitan scale according to income level and territorial location of households. This is followed by examination of three speciﬁc cases in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region that show the importance of territorial features when addressing mobility patterns of particular socioeconomically vulnerable groups, including: mobility of informal settlers in urban peripheries; mobility of domestic workers in gated communities; and mobility of residents at risk of displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods. The key ﬁndings highlight how the particular territorial conditions can intensify or attenuate the pre-existing socioeconomic inequality.},

Empirical results consistently demonstrate that expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate the subsequent home price growth, while restrictive monetary policy tends to decelerate the subsequent home price growth. These results suggest that Chinese monetary policy actions are the key driving forces behind the change of real estate price growth in China. We also show that hot money ﬂow does not have a signiﬁcant impact on the change of home price growth after controlling for the money supply growth. Finally, a bullish stock market tends to accelerate subsequent home price growth.},

By balancing the pros and cons of using typical hedonic frameworks versus urban forest inventory and management software systems, we (1) construct a data-driven approach to estimate the total amenity value associated with access to, views of, and existence of a particular forest landscape from among all available forest sites in a community and (2) develop a framework for an amenity value calculator for numerous community forest landscapes within a metropolitan county, using the amenity values generated from objective (1), that can be accessed and understood by anyone who is interested in the beneﬁts provided by nearby community forests. Our research suggests that (i) residential household’s amenity value per acre of forest landscape decreases asymptotically towards zero as the driving time from a residential house increases, (ii) an amenity value calculator can be developed to sum the amenity values across all detached single-family houses within a range of driving times from any selected forest landscape, and (iii) a user-friendly, web-based application, that allows users to view the estimated amenity values of forest landscapes that interest them, can be created to better inform the public about the values of forest landscapes of interest to them.},

By integrating open data from Lianjia.com, Dianping.com, Mobike.com, and Baidu Map POI, we analyze spatial patterns of apartment prices and their association with local attributes in Shanghai. We ﬁnd that Shanghai's residential market still has a monocentric structure because of the centralized distribution of public transport facilities and amenities. Hedonic models further conﬁrm that structural attributes, accessibility, as well as public and private service amenities signiﬁcantly shape the real estate market. These factors also are diﬀerentiated so as to form a pattern of concentric rings. In the inner-city and expanded inner-city areas, public service amenities such as parks, schools, hospitals, and banks, as well as private service amenities such as entertainment, shopping, and residential service facilities, boost housing prices. In the suburbs, better access to bike sharing, bus stops, and metro stations are the top preferences for apartment buyers. Our study also indicates that the Chinese government needs to make public and private services more accessible, not only spatially in urban peripheries and villages, but also institutionally to lower income families who cannot aﬀord apartments in expensive neighborhoods.},

Assuming that there exist hidden acoustic topics and each audio clip is a mixture of those acoustic topics, we proposed a topic model that learns a probability distribution over a set of hidden topics of a given audio clip in an unsupervised manner. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for the topic model, and introduce the notion of acoustic words for supporting modeling within this framework. In audio description classification tasks using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the BBC database, the proposed acoustic topic model shows promising results by outperforming the Latent Perceptual Indexing (LPI) method in classifying onomatopoeia descriptions and semantic descriptions.},

We then examine the relationship between gentrification and social class in order to explain why and how local residents and grassroots organizations mount resistance to gentrification in three pericentral neighborhoods in the southern portion of Buenos Aires. Contemporary changes in these neighborhoods are driven by (1) the promotion of neoliberal urban renewal policies, and (2) the genesis and development of Law 341, a program that provides low-income people and organizations with loans for housing construction and renovation, and (3) the Programa de Autogestión de la Vivienda (the Self-Managed Housing Program), which supports cooperative-style housing management. Through two cases, we examine how the actions and strategies of grassroots organizations have countered some of the effects of gentrification in the South of Buenos Aires.},

	abstract = {The goal of this article is to trace the evolution of models of working memory and cognitive resources from the early 20th century to today. Linear flow models of information processing common in the 1960s and 1970s centered on the transfer of verbal information from a limited-capacity short-term memory store to long-term memory through rehearsal. Current conceptions see working memory as a dynamic system that includes both maintaining and manipulating information through a series of interactive components that include executive control and attentional resources. These models also reflect the evolution from an almost exclusive concentration on working memory for verbal materials to inclusion of a visual working memory component. Although differing in postulated mechanisms and emphasis, these evolving viewpoints all share the recognition that human information processing is a limited-capacity system with limits on the amount of information that can be attended to, remain activated in memory, and utilized at one time. These limitations take on special importance in spoken language comprehension, especially when the stimuli have complex linguistic structures or listening effort is increased by poor acoustic quality or reduced hearing acuity.},

Here, we present direct evidence that ensemble coding is also important for auditory processing. We found that listeners could accurately estimate the mean frequency of a set of logarithmically spaced pure tones presented in a temporal sequence (Experiment 1). Their performance was severely reduced when only a subset of tones from a given sequence was presented (Experiment 2), which demonstrates that ensemble coding is based on a substantial number of the tones in a sequence. This precise ensemble coding occurred despite very limited representation of individual tones from the sequence: Listeners were poor at identifying specific individual member tones (Experiment 3) and at determining their positions in the sequence (Experiment 4). Together, these results indicate that summary statistical coding is not limited to visual processing and is an important auditory mechanism for extracting ensemble frequency information from sequences of sounds.},

This is followed by a survey of how speech sounds and elements thereof are represented in the activity patterns along the auditory pathway. Then the evidence for a place representation of texture features of sound, comprising frequency, periodicity pitch, harmonicity in vowels, and direction and speed of frequency modulation, and for a temporal and synchrony representation of sound contours, comprising onsets, offsets, voice onset time, and low rate amplitude modulation, in auditory cortex is reviewed. Contours mark changes and transitions in sound and auditory cortex appears particularly sensitive to these dynamic aspects of sound. Texture determines which neurons, both cortical and subcortical, are activated by the sound whereas the contours modulate the activity of those neurons. Because contours are temporally represented in the majority of neurons activated by the texture aspects of sound, each of these neurons is part of an ensemble formed by the combination of contour and texture sensitivity. A multiplexed coding of complex sound is proposed whereby the contours set up widespread synchrony across those neurons in all auditory cortical areas that are activated by the texture of sound.

The model assumes that the ventral stream is largely bilaterally organized — although there are important computational differences between the left- and right-hemisphere systems — and that the dorsal stream is strongly left-hemisphere dominant.},

We propose to involve animals that live in anthropic environments as participants in design processes. The current relationships between animals and technology have an inevitable impact on their well-being and raise fundamental ethical questions concerning our design policies. Drawing from the work of Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway, we argue for a situated approach in which we reflect upon concrete design contexts. We explore the notion of becoming with as a conceptual framework for the intuitive and bodily understanding that takes place between humans and animals when they encounter one-another in shared contexts. Adopting a research through design approach, we further explore this notion by reflecting upon two different participatory design projects with two dogs. We found these reflections to offer valuable perspectives for designers to analyse and discuss their iterative processes.},

Both definitions are based on the literature and so agree very closely, involving the non-conscious use of prior knowl-edge for intuitive interaction. Models have been devised by both groups: a continuum of intuitive interaction and a continuum of prior knowledge. Although there are points of difference in the models it is found that these are minimal and that the models are complementary. Tools like design methodologies, design principles, questionnaires, and an online database have been devised by the two groups that can contribute to helping designers in making user interfaces more intuitive to use.},

Application domains in this direction involve virtual reality, augmented reality, wearable computing, and smart spaces. This paper presents two main approaches to developing and testing these interfaces using gestures. It presents the important issues in gesture communication, from a technological viewpoint as well as a user viewpoint such as the technological complexity, learning rate, ergonomics, and intuition. These issues must be taken into account when choosing the gesture vocabulary. A procedure is proposed which includes those issues in the selection of gestures, and to test the resulting set of gestures. The procedure is tested and demonstrated on an example application with a small test group. The procedure is concluded to be useful and time consuming. The importance of using theory from ergonomics is also concluded.},

Intuition is a type of cognitive processing that is often non-conscious and utilises stored experiential knowledge. Intuitive interaction involves the use of knowledge gained from other products and/or experiences. Two initial experimental studies revealed that prior exposure to products employing similar features helped participants to complete set tasks more quickly and intuitively, and that familiar features were intuitively used more often than unfamiliar ones. A third experiment confirmed that performance is affected by a person's level of familiarity with similar technologies, and also revealed that appearance (shape, size and labelling of features) seems to be the variable that most affects time spent on a task and intuitive uses during that time. Age also seems to have an effect. These results and their implications are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of any field of knowledge brings with it unavoidable fragmentation and proliferation of new disciplines. The development of computer science is no exception. Software engineering (SE) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are both relatively new disciplines of computer science. Furthermore, as both names suggest, they each have strong connections with other subjects. SE is concerned with methods and tools for general software development based on engineering principles. This discipline has its roots not only in computer science but also in a number of traditional engineering disciplines. HCI is concerned with methods and tools for the development of human-computer interfaces, assessing the usability of computer systems and with broader issues about how people interact with computers. It is based on theories about how humans process information and interact with computers, other objects and other people in the organizational and social contexts in which computers are used. HCI draws on knowledge and skills from psychology, anthropology and sociology in addition to computer science. Both disciplines need ways of measuring how well their products and development processes fulfil their intended requirements. Traditionally, SE has been concerned with “how software is constructed” and HCI with “how people use software”. Given the different histories of the disciplines and their different objectives, it is not surprising that they take different approaches to measurement, Thus, each has its own distinct “measurement culture”. In this paper we analyse the differences and the commonalities of the two cultures by examining the measurement approaches used by each. We then argue the need for a common measurement taxonomy and framework, which is derived from our analyses of the two disciplines. Next we demonstrate the usefulness of the taxonomy and framework via specific example studies drawn from our own work and that of others and show that, in fact, the two disciplines have many important similarities as well as differences and that there is some evidence to suggest that they are growing closer. Finally, we discuss the role of the taxonomy as a framework to support: reuse, planning future studies, guiding practice and facilitating communication between the two disciplines. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Comparable problems such as object detection in images have reaped enormous benefits from comprehensive datasets – principally ImageNet. This paper describes the creation of Audio Set, a large-scale dataset of manually-annotated audio events that endeavors to bridge the gap in data availability between image and audio research. Using a carefully structured hierarchical ontology of 632 audio classes guided by the literature and manual curation, we collect data from human labelers to probe the presence of specific audio classes in 10 second segments of YouTube videos. Segments are proposed for labeling using searches based on metadata, context (e.g., links), and content analysis. The result is a dataset of unprecedented breadth and size that will, we hope, substantially stimulate the de-velopment of high-performance audio event recognizers.},

Alternate activation functions having similar properties are also discussed. A fourlayer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The decision boundaries can be modified in real-time using new data as they become available, and can be implemented using artificial hardware “neurons” that operate entirely in parallel. Provision is also made for estimating the probability and reliability of a classification as well as making the decision. The technique offers a tremendous speed advantage for problems in which the incremental adaptation time of back propagation is a significant fraction of the total computation time. For one application, the PNN paradigm was 200,000 times faster than back-propagation.},

	abstract = {The present study examined the acute effects of hypoxia on the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism at rest and during 15 min of submaximal exercise. Subjects exercised on two occasions for 15 min at 55\% of their normoxic maximal oxygen uptake while breathing 11\% O(2) (hypoxia) or room air (normoxia). Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and after 1 and 15 min of exercise. At rest, no effects on muscle metabolism were observed in response to hypoxia. In the 1st min of exercise, glycogenolysis was significantly greater in hypoxia compared with normoxia. This small difference in glycogenolysis was associated with a tendency toward a greater concentration of substrate, free P(i), in hypoxia compared with normoxia. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (PDH(a)) was lower in hypoxia at 1 min compared with normoxia, resulting in a reduced rate of pyruvate oxidation and a greater lactate accumulation. During the last 14 min of exercise, glycogenolysis was greater in hypoxia despite a lower mole fraction of phosphorylase a. The greater glycogenolytic rate was maintained posttransformationally through significantly higher free [AMP] and [P(i)]. At the end of exercise, PDH(a) was greater in hypoxia compared with normoxia, contributing to a greater rate of pyruvate oxidation. Because of the higher glycogenolytic rate in hypoxia, the rate of pyruvate production continued to exceed the rate of pyruvate oxidation, resulting in significant lactate accumulation in hypoxia compared with no further lactate accumulation in normoxia. Hence, the elevated lactate production associated with hypoxia at the same absolute workload could in part be explained by the effects of hypoxia on the activities of the rate-limiting enzymes, phosphorylase and PDH, which regulate the rates of pyruvate production and pyruvate oxidation, respectively.},

	abstract = {Although Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a promising approach to similarity search in high-dimensional spaces, it has not been considered practical partly because its search quality is sensitive to several parameters that are quite data dependent. Previous research on LSH, though obtained in- teresting asymptotic results, provides little guidance on how these parameters should be chosen, and tuning parameters for a given dataset remains a tedious process. To address this problem, we present a statistical perfor- mance model of Multi-probe LSH, a state-of-the-art vari- ance of LSH. Our model can accurately predict the average search quality and latency given a small sample dataset. Apart from automatic parameter tuning with the perfor- mance model, we also use the model to devise an adaptive LSH search algorithm to determine the probing parameter dynamically for each query. The adaptive probing method addresses the problem that even though the average perfor- mance is tuned for optimal, the variance of the performance is extremely high. We experimented with three different datasets including audio, images and 3D shapes to evaluate our methods. The results show the accuracy of the proposed model: the recall errors predicted are within 5\% from the real values for most cases; the adaptive search method re- duces the standard deviation of recall by about 50\% over the existing method.

	abstract = {In this work, we report on a novel application of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to seismic data at scale. Based on the high waveform similarity between reoccurring earthquakes, our application identifies potential earthquakes by searching for similar time series segments via LSH. However, a straightforward implementation of this LSH-enabled application has difficulty scaling beyond 3 months of continuous time series data measured at a single seismic station. As a case study of a data-driven science workflow, we illustrate how domain knowledge can be incorporated into the workload to improve both the efficiency and result quality. We describe several end-to-end optimizations of the analysis pipeline from pre-processing to post-processing, which allow the application to scale to time series data measured at multiple seismic stations. Our optimizations enable an over 100x speed up in the end-to-end analysis pipeline. This improved scalability enabled seismologists to perform seismic analysis on more than ten years of continuous time series data from over ten seismic stations, and has directly enabled the discovery of 597 new earthquakes near the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California and 6123 new earthquakes in New Zealand.},

	abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

We collect a data set of 1700 human-generated annotations that describe 500 Western popular music tracks. For each word in a vocabulary, we use this data to train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) over an audio feature space. We estimate the parameters of the model using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation maximization algorithm. This algorithm is more scalable to large data sets and produces better density estimates than standard parameter estimation techniques. The quality of the music annotations produced by our system is comparable with the performance of humans on the same task. Our " query-by-text " system can retrieve appropriate songs for a large number of musically relevant words. We also show that our audition system is general by learning a model that can annotate and retrieve sound effects.},

However, there is not yet a good study about the effectiveness of different features and distance measures. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative study on various audio features and various distance measures (similarity measures). The compared audio features include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Linear Predictive Coding Coefficients (LPC), sub-band energy distribution and some other temporal/spectral features, while the compared distances include Euclidean distance, Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence, Mahalanobis distance and Bhattacharyya distance.

	abstract = {Query-by-semantic-description (QBSD)is a natural paradigm for retrieving content from large databases of music. A major impediment to the development of good QBSD systems for music information retrieval has been the lack of a cleanly-labeled, publicly-available, heterogeneous data set of songs and associated annotations. We have collected the Computer Audition Lab 500-song (CAL500) data set by having humans listen to and annotate songs using a survey designed to capture 'semantic associations' between music and words. We adapt the supervised multi-class labeling (SML) model, which has shown good performance on the task of image retrieval, and use the CAL500 data to learn a model for music retrieval. The model parameters are estimated using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation-maximization algorithm which has been specifically designed to handle real-valued semantic association between words and songs, rather than binary class labels. The output of the SML model, a vector of class-conditional probabilities, can be interpreted as a semantic multinomial distribution over a vocabulary. By also representing a semantic query as a query multinomial distribution, we can quickly rank order the songs in a database based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query multinomial and each song's semantic multinomial. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SML model can both annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs given a multi-word, text-based query.},

This technique uses three concepts from the psychophysics of hearing to derive an estimate of the auditory spectrum: (1) the critical-band spectral resolution, (2) the equal-loudness curve, and (3) the intensity-loudness power law. The auditory spectrum is then approximated by an autoregressive all-pole model. A 5th-order all-pole model is effective in suppressing speaker-dependent details of the auditory spectrum. In comparison with conventional linear predictive (LP) analysis, PLP analysis is more consistent with human hearing. The effective second formant F2' and the 3.5-Bark spectral-peak integration theories of vowel perception are well accounted for. PLP analysis is computationally efficient and yields a low-dimensional representation of speech. These properties are found to be useful in speaker-independent automatic-speech recognition.},

An examination of the coninuum of structured energy from events to audition suggests that sound conveys information about events at locations in an environment. Qualitative descriptions of the physics of sound-producing events into those involving vibrating solids, gasses, or liquids. Within each of these categories, basic-level events are defined by the simple interactions that can cause these materials to sound, whereas more complex events can be descrived in terms of temporal patterning, compound, or hybrid sources. The results of these investigations are used to creat a map of sound-producing events and their attributes useful in guiding furhter exploration.},

Recent digitization efforts in some of the larger animal sound archives bring other types of audio recordings into the focus of interest. Although recordings in animal sound archives are usually very well annotated by metadata, it is almost impossible to manually annotate all sounds made by animals in each recording. Complementary to classical text-based querying of databases that exploit available annotations, algorithms capable of automatically finding sections of recordings similar to a given query fragment provide a promising approach for content-based navigation. In our work, we present algorithms for feature extraction, as well as indexing and retrieval of animal sound recordings. Making use of a concept from image processing, the structure tensor, our feature extraction algorithm is adapted to the typical curve-like spectral features that are characteristic for many types of animal sounds. We propose a method for similarity search in animal sound databases which is obtained by adding a novel ranking scheme to an existing inverted file based approach for multimedia retrieval. Evaluation of our methods is based on recordings from the Animal Sound Archive, Berlin.},

Recent advances in machine learning, as well as in computational models of the human auditory system, have contributed to advances in this increasingly popular research field. Robust sound event classification, the ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, is an especially challenging task. Classification methods translated from the speech recognition domain, using features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, have been shown to perform reasonably well for the sound event classification task, although spectrogram-based or auditory image analysis techniques reportedly achieve superior performance in noise. This paper outlines a sound event classification framework that compares auditory image front end features with spectrogram image-based front end features, using support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers. Performance is evaluated on a standard robust classification task in different levels of corrupting noise, and with several system enhancements, and shown to compare very well with current state-of-the-art classification techniques.},

The central idea is to learn a probability distribution over a set of latent topics of a given audio clip in an unsupervised manner, assuming that there exist latent acoustic topics and each audio clip can be described in terms of those latent acoustic topics. In this regard, we use the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to implement the acoustic topic models over elemental acoustic units, referred as acoustic words, and perform text-like audio signal processing. Experiments on audio tag classification with the BBC sound effects library demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed latent audio context modeling schemes. In particular, the proposed method is shown to be superior to other latent structure analysis methods, such as latent semantic analysis and probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We also demonstrate that topic models can be used as complementary features to content-based features and offer about 9\% relative improvement in audio classification when combined with the traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique.},

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves tremendous improvements in performance in the offline case, and significant improvements in the fastest possible arrival rate of the data stream that can be processed with guaranteed no false dismissal.},

This content-based approach differs from retrieval approaches that index media files using metadata such as file names and user tags. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for retrieving sounds that is novel in that it (1) uses free-form text queries rather sound sample based queries, (2) searches by audio content rather than via textual meta data, and (3) can scale to very large number of audio documents and very rich query vocabulary. We handle generic sounds, including a wide variety of sound effects, animal vocalizations and natural scenes. We test a scalable approach based on a passive-aggressive model for image retrieval (PAMIR), and compare it to two state-of-the-art approaches; Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and support vector machines (SVM). We test our approach on two large real-world datasets: a collection of short sound effects, and a noisier and larger collection of user-contributed user-labeled recordings (25K files, 2000 terms vocabulary). We find that all three methods achieved very good retrieval performance. For instance, a positive document is retrieved in the first position of the ranking more than half the time, and on average there are more than 4 positive documents in the first 10 retrieved, for both datasets. PAMIR completed both training and retrieval of all data in less than 6 hours for both datasets, on a single machine. It was one to three orders of magnitude faster than the competing approaches. This approach should therefore scale to much larger datasets in the future.},

The platform is the result of a multidisciplinary design process, which has involved bio-engineers, developmental neuroscientists, primatologists, and roboticians to identify its main requirements and specifications. Although such a platform has been designed for the behavioral analysis of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), it can be used for behavioral studies on other nonhuman primates and children. First, a state-of-the-art principal approach used in nonhuman primate behavioral studies is reported. Second, the main advantages of the mechatronic approach are presented. In this section, the platform is described in all its parts and the possibility to use it for studies on learning mechanism based on intrinsic motivation discussed. Third, a pilot study on capuchin monkeys is provided and preliminary data are presented and discussed.},

Here, three captive adult American black bears were presented with a series of natural concept discrimination tasks on a touchscreen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. The more abstract discriminations could not be performed by attending to perceptual features of the stimuli alone. For instance, at the most abstract level, the bears were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. At least one bear performed at above-chance levels with transfer to novel images at each level of abstraction. The bear that began testing with the most abstract problems showed the best transfer on more abstract discriminations, suggesting that the usual practice of overtraining animals on perceptual discriminations may hinder their ability to acquire concepts at more abstract levels. The bears' performance suggests that a generalized diet may be more critical than group living with regard to the evolution of complex cognition in carnivores. © 2012.},

User-centered design applied to non-human animals is showing to be a promising research line known as Animal Computer Interaction (ACI), aimed at improving animals' wellbeing using technology. Within this research line, intelligent systems for animal entertainment could have remarkable benefits for their mental and physical wellbeing, while providing new ways of communication and amusement between humans and animals. In order to create user-centered interactive intelligent systems for animals, we first need to understand how they spontaneously interact with technology, and develop suitable mechanisms to adapt to the animals' observed interactions and preferences. Therefore, this paper describes a pioneer study on cats' preferences and behaviors with different technological devices. It also presents the design and evaluation of a promising depth-based tracking system for the detection of cats' body parts and postures.

However, non-wearable mechanisms such as depth-based tracking could also make use of machine learning techniques and classifiers for the automatic detection of animals’ behavior. These systems also offer the advantage of working in set-ups in which wearable devices would be difficult to use. This paper presents a depth-based tracking system for the automatic detection of animals’ postures and body parts, as well as an exhaustive evaluation on the performance of several classification algorithms based on both a supervised and a knowledge-based approach. The evaluation of the depth-based tracking system and the different classifiers shows that the system proposed is promising for advancing the research on animals’ behavior recognition within and outside the field of Animal Computer Interaction.},

We use the notion of {\textbackslash}emph\{animal welfare\} in broad terms, to review the technologies for assessing whether animals are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and also positively stimulated in their environment. Also the notion of {\textbackslash}emph\{smart computing and sensing\} is used in broad terms, to refer to computing and sensing systems that are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of remote data collection, processing, exchange and analysis. We review smart technologies for domestic animals, indoor and outdoor animal farming, as well as animals in the wild and zoos. The findings of this review are expected to motivate future research and contribute to data, information and communication management as well as policy for animal welfare.},

Technologically-mediated playful scenarios for animals will therefore require contextual information about the game participants, such as their location or body posture, in order to suitably adapt the system reactions. This paper presents a depth-based tracking system for cats capable of detecting their location, body posture and field of view.

If this hypothesis is true, we should expect to find cross-species acoustic universals in emotional vocalizations. Studies suggest that acoustic attributes of aroused vocalizations are shared across many mammalian species, and that humans can use these attributes to infer emotional content. But do these acoustic attributes extend to non-mammalian vertebrates? In this study, we asked human participants to judge the emotional content of vocalizations of nine vertebrate species repre-senting three different biological classes—Amphibia, Reptilia (non-aves and aves) and Mammalia. We found that humans are able to identify higher levels of arousal in vocalizations across all species. This result was consistent across different language groups (English, German and Mandarin native speakers), suggesting that this ability is biologically rooted in humans. Our findings indicate that humans use multiple acoustic parameters to infer relative arousal in vocalizations for each species, but mainly rely on fundamen-tal frequency and spectral centre of gravity to identify higher arousal vocalizations across species. These results suggest that fundamental mechan-isms of vocal emotional expression are shared among vertebrates and could represent a homologous signalling system.},

We present our preliminary efforts towards a wireless wearable system for continuous auscultation of respiratory behavior by recording internal sounds at the neck and chest by means of a commercially available electronic stethoscope to provide objective decision support for handlers. We have identified discrete features of sniffing and panting in the time domain and utilize event duration, event rate, event mean energy, and the number of consecutive events in a row to build a decision tree classifier. Since feature extraction requires segmentation of individual sniffing and panting events, we developed an adaptive method using short-time energy contour and an adaptive threshold. The performance of the system was evaluated on recordings from a Greyhound and a Labrador Retriever and achieved high classification accuracies.},

One challenge in this race is that each new statistical technique must be implemented from scratch in the RDBMS, which leads to a lengthy and complex development process. We argue that the root cause for this overhead is the lack of a unified architecture for in-database analytics. Our main contribution in this work is to take a step towards such a unified architecture. A key benefit of our unified architecture is that performance optimizations for analytics techniques can be studied generically instead of an ad hoc, per-technique fashion. In particular, our technical contributions are theoretical and empirical studies of two key factors that we found impact performance: the order data is stored, and parallelization of computations on a single-node multicore RDBMS. We demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture by integrating several popular analytics techniques into two commercial and one open-source RDBMS. Our architecture requires changes to only a few dozen lines of code to integrate a new statistical technique. We then compare our approach with the native analytics tools offered by the commercial RDBMSes on various analytics tasks, and validate that our approach achieves competitive or higher performance, while still achieving the same quality.},

	abstract = {During exploratory statistical analysis, data scientists repeatedly compute statistics on data sets to infer knowledge. Moreover, statis-tics form the building blocks of core machine learning classifi-cation and filtering algorithms. Modern data systems, software libraries, and domain-specific tools provide support to compute statistics but lack a cohesive framework for storing, organizing, and reusing them. This creates a significant problem for exploratory statistical analysis as data grows: Despite existing overlap in ex-ploratory workloads (which are repetitive in nature), statistics are always computed from scratch. This leads to repeated data move-ment and recomputation, hindering interactive data exploration. We address this challenge in Data Canopy, where descriptive and dependence statistics are synthesized from a library of basic ag-gregates. These basic aggregates are stored within an in-memory data structure, and and are reused for overlapping data parts and for various statistical measures What this means for exploratory statis-tical analysis is that repeated requests to compute different statis-tics do not trigger a full pass over the data. We discuss in detail the basic design elements in Data Canopy, which address multiple challenges: (1) How to decompose statistics into basic aggregates for maximal reuse? (2) How to represent, store, maintain, and ac-cess these basic aggregates? (3) Under different scenarios, which basic aggregates to maintain? (4) How to tune Data Canopy in a hardware conscious way for maximum performance and how to maintain good performance as data grows and memory pressure increases? We demonstrate experimentally that Data Canopy results in an average speed-up of at least 10× after just 100 exploratory queries when compared with state-of-the-art systems used for exploratory statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {Data structures are critical in any data-driven scenario, but they are notoriously hard to design due to a massive design space and the dependence of performance on workload and hardware which evolve continuously. We present a design engine, the Data Cal-culator, which enables interactive and semi-automated design of data structures. It brings two innovations. First, it oï¿¿ers a set of ï¿¿ne-grained design primitives that capture the ï¿¿rst principles of data layout design: how data structure nodes lay data out, and how they are positioned relative to each other. This allows for a structured description of the universe of possible data structure designs that can be synthesized as combinations of those primi-tives. The second innovation is computation of performance using learned cost models. These models are trained on diverse hardware and data proï¿¿les and capture the cost properties of fundamental data access primitives (e.g., random access). With these models, we synthesize the performance cost of complex operations on arbi-trary data structure designs without having to: 1) implement the data structure, 2) run the workload, or even 3) access the target hardware. We demonstrate that the Data Calculator can assist data structure designers and researchers by accurately answering rich what-if design questions on the order of a few seconds or minutes, i.e., computing how the performance (response time) of a given data structure design is impacted by variations in the: 1) design, 2) hardware, 3) data, and 4) query workloads. This makes it eï¿¿ortless to test numerous designs and ideas before embarking on lengthy implementation, deployment, and hardware acquisition steps. We also demonstrate that the Data Calculator can synthesize entirely new designs, auto-complete partial designs, and detect suboptimal design choices. Let us calculate. —Gottfried Leibniz},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04436},
	abstract = {Synthesizing SQL queries from natural language is a long-standing open problem and has been attracting considerable interest recently. Toward solving the problem, the de facto approach is to employ a sequence-to-sequence-style model. Such an approach will necessarily require the SQL queries to be serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent serializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the choice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the "order-matters" problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations. However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally solve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the order does not matter. In particular, we employ a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph so that one prediction can be done by taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In addition, we propose a sequence-to-set model as well as the column attention mechanism to synthesize the query based on the sketch. By combining all these novel techniques, we show that SQLNet can outperform the prior art by 9\% to 13\% on the WikiSQL task.},

	abstract = {Context: Databases are an integral element of enterprise applications. Similarly to code, database schemas are also prone to smells - best practice violations. Objective: We aim to explore database schema quality, associated characteristics and their relationships with other software artifacts. Method: We present a catalog of 13 database schema smells and elicit developers' perspective through a survey. We extract embedded sql statements and identify database schema smells by employing the DbDeo tool which we developed. We analyze 2925 production-quality systems (357 industrial and 2568 well-engineered open-source projects) and empirically study quality characteristics of their database schemas. In total, we analyze 629 million lines of code containing more than 393 thousand sql statements. Results: We find that the index abuse smell occurs most frequently in database code, that the use of an orm framework doesn't immune the application from database smells, and that some database smells, such as adjacency list, are more prone to occur in industrial projects compared to open-source projects. Our co-occurrence analysis shows that whenever the clone table smell in industrial projects and the values in attribute definition smell in open-source projects get spotted, it is very likely to find other database smells in the project. Conclusion: The awareness and knowledge of database smells are crucial for developing high-quality software systems and can be enhanced by the adoption of better tools helping developers to identify database smells early.},

In this paper, we studied 27 real-world open-source applications built on top of the popular Ruby on Rails ORM framework, with the goal to understand the database-related performance inefficiencies in these applications. We discovered a number of inefficiencies rang-ing from physical design issues to how queries are expressed in the application code. We applied static program analysis to identify and measure how prevalent these issues are, then suggested techniques to alleviate these issues and measured the potential performance gain as a result. These techniques significantly reduce database query time (up to 91\%) and the webpage response time (up to 98\%). Our study provides guidance to the design of future database en-gines and ORM frameworks to support database application that are performant yet without sacrificing programmability.},

	abstract = {As data sets grow and conventional processor performance scaling slows, data analytics move towards heterogeneous architectures that incorporate hardware accelerators (notably GPUs) to continue scaling performance. However, existing GPU-based databases fail to deal with big data applications efficiently: their execution model suffers from scalability limitations on GPUs whose memory capacity is limited; existing systems fail to consider the discrepancy between fast GPUs and slow storage, which can counteract the benefit of GPU accelerators. In this paper, we propose HippogriffDB, an efficient, scalable GPU-accelerated OLAP system. It tackles the bandwidth discrepancy using compression and an optimized data transfer path. HippogriffDB stores tables in a compressed format and uses the GPU for decompression, trading GPU cycles for the improved I/O bandwidth. To improve the data transfer efficiency, HippogriffDB introduces a peer-to-peer, multi-threaded data transfer mechanism, directly transferring data from the SSD to the GPU. HippogriffDB adopts a query-over-block execution model that provides scalability using a stream-based approach. The model improves kernel efficiency with the operator fusion and double buffering mechanism. We have implemented HippogriffDB using an NVMe SSD, which talks directly to a commercial GPU. Results on two popular benchmarks demonstrate its scalability and efficiency. HippogriffDB outperforms existing GPU-based databases (YDB) and in-memory data analytics (MonetDB) by 1-2 orders of magnitude.},

This is necessary to allow the system to anticipate future work-load needs and select the proper optimizations in a timely manner. Previous forecasting techniques model the resource utilization of the queries. Such metrics, however, change whenever the physical design of the database and the hardware resources change, thereby rendering previous forecasting models useless. We present a robust forecasting framework called QueryBot 5000 that allows a DBMS to predict the expected arrival rate of queries in the future based on historical data. To better support highly dynamic environments, our approach uses the logical composition of queries in the workload rather than the amount of physical resources used for query execution. It provides multiple horizons (short-vs. long-term) with different aggregation intervals. We also present a clustering-based technique for reducing the total number of forecasting models to maintain. To evaluate our approach, we compare our forecasting models against other state-of-the-art models on three real-world database traces. We implemented our models in an external controller for PostgreSQL and MySQL and demonstrate their effectiveness in selecting indexes.},

	abstract = {As video volumes grow, analysts have increasingly turned to deep learning to process visual data. While these deep networks deliver impressive levels of accuracy, they execute as much as 10x slower than real time (3 fps) on a \$8,000 GPU, which is infeasible at scale. In addition, deploying these methods requires writing complex, imperative code with many low-level libraries (e.g., OpenCV, MXNet), an often ad-hoc and time-consuming process that ignores opportunities for cross-operator optimization. To address the computational and usability challenges of video analytics at scale, we introduce BLAZEIT, a system that optimizes queries over video for spatiotemporal information of objects. BLAZEIT accepts queries via FRAMEQL, a declarative language for exploratory video analytics, that enables video-specific query optimization. We propose new query optimization techniques uniquely suited to video analytics that are not supported by prior work. First, we adapt control variates to video analytics and provide advances in specialization for aggregation queries. Second, we adapt importance-sampling using specialized NNs for cardinality-limited video search (i.e. scrubbing queries). Third, we show how to infer new classes of filters for content-based selection. By combining these optimizations, BLAZEIT can deliver over three order of magnitude speedups over the recent literature on video processing.},

However, the ability for users to retrieve facts from a database is limited due to a lack of understanding of query languages such as SQL. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding SQL queries. Our model leverages the structure of SQL queries to significantly reduce the output space of generated queries. Moreover, we use rewards from in-the-loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate unordered parts of the query, which we show are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. In addition, we will publish WikiSQL, a dataset of 80654 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries distributed across 24241 tables from Wikipedia. This dataset is required to train our model and is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy-based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to WikiSQL, our model Seq2SQL outperforms attentional sequence to sequence models, improving execution accuracy from 35.9\% to 59.4\% and logical form accuracy from 23.4\% to 48.3\%.},

Our goal is to present relational data in the most efficient way via voice output. This problem setting is motivated by emerging tools and devices (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple's Siri, or voice-based SQL interfaces) that communicate data pri-marily via audio output to their users. We treat voice output generation as an optimization prob-lem. The goal is to minimize speaking time while trans-mitting an approximation of a relational table to the user. We consider constraints on the precision of the transmitted data as well as on the cognitive load placed on the listener. We formalize voice output optimization and show that it is NP-hard. We present three approaches to solve that prob-lem. First, we show how the problem can be translated into an integer linear program which enables us to apply corre-sponding solvers. Second, we present a two-phase approach that forms groups of similar rows in a pre-processing step, using a variant of the apriori algorithm. Then, we select an optimal combination of groups to generate a speech. Fi-nally, we present a greedy algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Under simplifying assumptions, we prove that it gen-erates near-optimal output by leveraging the sub-modularity property of our cost function. We compare our algorithms experimentally and analyze their complexity.},

	abstract = {Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a new storage technology that combines the performance and byte addressability of DRAM with the persistence of traditional storage devices like flash (SSD). While these properties make NVM highly promising, it is not yet clear how to best integrate NVM into the storage layer of modern database systems. Two system designs have been proposed. The first is to use NVM exclusively, i.e., to store all data and index structures on it. However, because NVM has a higher latency than DRAM, this design can be less efficient than main-memory database systems. For this reason, the second approach uses a page-based DRAM cache in front of NVM. This approach, however, does not utilize the byte addressability of NVM and, as a result, accessing an uncached tuple on NVM requires retrieving an entire page. In this work, we evaluate these two approaches and compare them with in-memory databases as well as more traditional buffer managers that use main memory as a cache in front of SSDs. This al-lows us to determine how much performance gain can be expected from NVM. We also propose a lightweight storage manager that si-multaneously supports DRAM, NVM, and flash. Our design utilizes the byte addressability of NVM and uses it as an additional caching layer that improves performance without losing the benefits from the even faster DRAM and the large capacities of SSDs.},

	abstract = {The data revolution is fueled by advances in several areas, including databases, high-performance computer architecture, and machine learning. Although timely, there is a void of solutions that brings these disjoint directions together. This paper sets out to be the initial step towards such a union. The aim is to devise a solution for the in-Database Acceleration of Advanced Analytics (DAnA). DAnA empowers database users to leap beyond traditional data summarization techniques and seamlessly utilize hardware-accelerated machine learning. Deploying specialized hardware, such as FPGAs, for in-database analytics currently requires hand-designing the hardware and manually routing the data. Instead, DAnA automatically maps a high-level specification of in-database analytics queries to the FPGA accelerator. The accelerator implementation is generated from a User Defined Function (UDF), expressed as part of a SQL query in a Python-embedded Domain Specific Language (DSL). To realize efficient in-database integration, DAnA accelerators contain a novel hardware structure, Striders, that directly interface with the buffer pool of the database. DAnA obtains the schema and page layout information from the database catalog to configure the Striders. In turn, Striders extract, cleanse, and process the training data tuples, which are consumed by a multi-threaded FPGA engine that executes the analytics algorithm. We integrated DAnA with PostgreSQL to generate hardware accelerators for a range of real-world and synthetic datasets running diverse ML algorithms. Results show that DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL provides, on average, 11.3x end-to-end speedup than MADLib and 5.4x faster than multi-threaded MADLib running on Greenplum. DAnA provides these benefits while hiding the complexity of hardware design from data scientists and allowing them to express the algorithm in 30-60 lines of Python.},

But this is historically a difficult task because DBMSs have hundreds of configuration " knobs " that control everything in the system, such as the amount of memory to use for caches and how often data is written to storage. The problem with these knobs is that they are not standardized (i.e., two DBMSs use a different name for the same knob), not independent (i.e., changing one knob can impact others), and not universal (i.e., what works for one application may be sub-optimal for another). Worse, information about the effects of the knobs typically comes only from (expensive) experience. To overcome these challenges, we present an automated approach that leverages past experience and collects new information to tune DBMS configurations: we use a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods to (1) select the most impact-ful knobs, (2) map unseen database workloads to previous work-loads from which we can transfer experience, and (3) recommend knob settings. We implemented our techniques in a new tool called OtterTune and tested it on three DBMSs. Our evaluation shows that OtterTune recommends configurations that are as good as or better than ones generated by existing tools or a human expert.},

The challenge is that scaling applications to operate on these datasets requires efficient systems for pixel data access and parallel processing across large numbers of machines. Few programmers have the capability to operate efficiently at these scales, limiting the field's ability to explore new applications that leverage big video data. In response, we have created Scanner, a system for productive and efficient video analysis at scale. Scanner organizes video collections as tables in a data store optimized for sampling frames from compressed video, and executes pixel processing computations, expressed as dataflow graphs, on these frames. Scanner schedules video analysis applications expressed using these abstractions onto heterogeneous throughput computing hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and media processing ASICs, for high-throughput pixel processing. We demonstrate the productivity of Scanner by authoring a variety of video processing applications including the synthesis of stereo VR video streams from multi-camera rigs, markerless 3D human pose reconstruction from video, and data-mining big video datasets such as hundreds of feature-length films or over 70,000 hours of TV news. These applications achieve near-expert performance on a single machine and scale efficiently to hundreds of machines, enabling formerly long-running big video data analysis tasks to be carried out in minutes to hours.},

	abstract = {Enterprises increasingly employ a wide array of tools and processes to make data-driven decisions. However, there are large inefficiencies in the enterprise-wide workflow that stem from the fact that business workflows are expressed in nat-ural language but the actual computational workflow has to be manually translated into computational programs. In this paper, we present an initial approach to bridge this gap by targeting the data science component of enterprise work-flows. In many cases, this component is the slowest part of the overall enterprise process, and focusing on it allows us to take an initial step in solving the larger enterprise-wide pro-ductivity problem. In this initial approach, we propose using a chatbot to allow a data scientist to assemble data analytics pipelines. A crucial insight is that while precise interpreta-tion of general natural language continues to be challenging, controlled natural language methods are starting to become practical as natural interfaces in complex decision-making domains. In addition, we recognize that data science work-flow components are often templatized. Putting these two insights together, we develop a practical system, called Ava, that uses (controlled) natural language to program data sci-ence workflows.

	abstract = {Exhaustive enumeration of all possible join orders is often avoided, and most optimizers leverage heuristics to prune the search space. The design and implementation of heuristics are well-understood when the cost model is roughly linear, and we find that these heuristics can be significantly suboptimal when there are non-linearities in cost. Ideally, instead of a fixed heuristic, we would want a strategy to guide the search space in a more data-driven way---tailoring the search to a specific dataset and query workload. Recent work in deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) may provide a new perspective on this problem. Deep RL poses sequential problems, like join optimization, as a series of 1-step prediction problems that can be learned from data. We present our deep RL-based DQ optimizer, which currently optimizes select-project-join blocks, and we evaluate DQ on the Join Order Benchmark. We found that DQ achieves plan costs within a factor of 2 of the optimal solution on all cost models and improves on the next best heuristic by up to \$3{\textbackslash}times\$. Furthermore, DQ executes 10,000\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than exhaustive enumeration and more than 10\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than left/right-deep enumeration on the largest queries in the benchmark.},

The results show that unit, integration, system and acceptance testing are the most frequent testing techniques used, but usability testing is not that common. Neither are alpha, beta, performance/load and security testing. Interviews were conducted to exemplify how practitioners conduct usability testing and what they describe as the difference between usability and acceptance testing. Some examples from the interviews show that practitioners are willing to do formal usability testing on extensive parts of the system, but because the iterations in Scrum are short and the changes to the system in each iteration are small, formal usability testing does not fit into the project work.},

	abstract = {The emerging discipline of Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI) aims to take what in Interaction Design is known as a user-centred approach to the design of technology intended for animals, placing them at the centre of the design process as stakeholders, users, and contributors. However, current regulatory frameworks for the involvement of animals in research are not animal-centred, regarding them as research instruments, unable to consent to procedures that may harm them, rather than consenting research participants and design contributors. Such frameworks aim to minimise the impacts of research procedures on the welfare of individual animals, but this minimisation is subordinated to specific scientific and societal interests, and to the integrity of the procedures required to serve those interests. From this standpoint, the universally advocated principles of replacement, reduction and refinement aim to address the ethical conflicts arising from the assumed inability of individual animals to consent to potentially harmful procedures, but such principles in fact reflect a lack of individual centrality. This paper makes the case for moving beyond existing regulations and guidelines towards an animal-centred framework that can better support the development of ACI as a discipline. Firstly, recognising animal welfare as a fundamental requirement for users and research participants alike, the paper articulates the implications of a welfare-centred ethics framework. Secondly, recognising consent as an essential requirement of participation, the paper also defines criteria for obtaining animals׳ mediated and contingent consent to engaging with research procedures. Further, the paper argues for the methodological necessity, as well as the ethical desirability, of such an animal-centred framework, examining the boundaries of its applicability as well as the benefits of its application. Finally, the paper puts forward a series of practical principles for conducting ACI research, which imply but also essentially exceed the welfare and ethics requirements of current regulatory frameworks.},

Its evolution is technologically important because it allows the open-ended development of tools. New Caledonian crows manufacture an impressive range of stick and leaf tools. We previously reported that their toolkit included hooked implements made from leafy twigs, although their manufacture had never been closely observed. We describe the manufacture of 10 hooked-twig tools by an adult crow and its dependent juvenile. To make all 10 tools, the crows carried out a relatively invariant three-step sequence of complex manipulations that involved (i) the selection of raw material, (ii) trimming and (iii) a lengthy sculpting of the hook. Hooked-twig manufacture contrasts with the lack of sculpting in the making of wooden tools by other non-humans such as chimpanzees and woodpecker finches. This fine, three-stage crafting process removes another alleged difference between humans and other animals.},

	abstract = {Design studies that use radiotelemetry require careful consideration of the goals of a project and the resources available to meet those goals. Success in meeting the research goals depends on thoughtful planning of field methods and ancillary data collection, selection of telemetry equipment appropriate to the study animal and budget, careful execution of the field protocols, and creative analysis of the data. Some of the most important design factors include consideration of the study's purpose; degree of experimental manipulation, controls, and replication; selection of an efficient yet unbiased sampling scheme; definition of the sample unit; calculation of sample size requirements; identification and removal of sources of bias; and clear specification of biological significance. This chapter emphasizes the need to integrate univariate metrics of animal choice, such as estimates of home range size and resource selection, with metrics for the demographic consequences of these choices, all of which can be generated from radiotelemetry. Radiotelemetry is an essential tool in modern studies of movement, migration, and dispersal of most vertebrates. Its use has dramatically increased the amount and detail of information available for estimating movements of larger animals, and provides extremely valuable additions to information from studies that use tagging, banding (ringing), and other forms of marking for smaller animals. In addition, radiotelemetry studies are an important complement to recent approaches that use genetic markers.},

Here we provide the most comprehensive review to date of dog cognition research, capturing all the articles (285) we could find on the subject going back to 1911. We begin by summarizing the general research trends, first documenting the rapid recent growth in dog cognition research (particularly in the domain of social cognition), and then identifying a number of trends in terms of the cognition topics and dog populations studied. Next, we summarize and synthesize the substantive conclusions emerging from research on nonsocial (discrimination learning, object permanence, object learning, categorization, object manipulation, quantitative understanding, spatial cognition, and memory) and social (responses to human cues, perspective taking, dog-human communication, and social learning) cognition. In light of the burgeoning research on individual differences in cognition and on the biological organization of cognitive domains, we highlight the potential impact of these topics on the dog cognition field. Finally, based on our syntheses, we outline some ideas for future research, including recommendations that studies focus on: (1) incorporating multiple sensory modalities (most notably olfaction); (2) using more diverse populations of subjects; (3) replicating studies where current knowledge is based on small study sets or on small samples; (4) identifying fundamental developmental patterns of cognitive development; (5) identifying individual differences in cognitive ability; and (6) identifying potential cognitive constraints (e.g. cognitive abilities that are nonindependent due to pleiotropic biological organization).},

	abstract = {Excessive food intake and the resulting excess weight gain is a growing problem in human and canine populations. Dogs, due to their shared living environment with humans, may provide a beneficial model to study the causes and consequences of obesity. Here, we make use of two well-established research paradigms (two-way choice paradigm and cognitive bias test), previously applied with dogs, to investigate the role of obesity and obesity-prone breeds for food responsiveness. We found no evidence of breed differences in food responsiveness due to one breed being more prone to obesity than another. Breed differences found in this study, however, can be explained by working dog status, i.e. whether the dog works in cooperation with, or independently from, humans. Our results also confirm that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain. These results are very similar to those expected from the parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in humans.},

Seventy-two percent of owners used some form of positive punishment. The mean number of potentially undesirable behaviors reported was 11.3 per dog. Attendance at formal training classes did not significantly affect the total number of potentially undesirable behaviors reported. However, dogs that had attended puppy socialization classes were less likely to show an undesirable reaction to dogs from outside the household, and owners who carried out informal training at home, but did not attend any form of formal training class, were more likely to report some form of aggression in their dog. The training method used by owners was also related to the total number of potentially undesirable behaviors shown by the dogs. When individual categories of potentially undesirable behavior were investigated, the type of training method used was also significantly associated with attention-seeking score, fear (avoidance) score, and aggression score. Other factors related to the overall number of potentially undesirable behaviors included the age and origin of the dog.},

Early prediction of successful service dog placement could save time, resources, and funding. Our research focus is to explore whether aspects of canine temperament can be detected from interactions with sensors, and to develop classifiers that correlate sensor data to predict the success (or failure) of assistance dogs in advanced training. In a 2-year longitudinal study, our team tested a cohort of dogs entering advanced training in the Canine Companions for Independence (CCI) Program with 2 instrumented dog toys: a silicone ball and a silicone tug sensor. We then create a logistic model tree classifier to predict service dog success using only 5 features derived from dog-toy interactions. During randomized 10-fold cross validation where 4 of the 40 dogs were kept in an independent test set for each fold, our classifier predicts the dogs' outcomes with 87.5\% average accuracy. We assess the reliability of our model by performing the testing routine 10 times over 1.5 years for a single suitable working dog, which predicts that the dog would pass each time. We calculate the resource benefit of identifying dogs who will fail early in their training, and the value for a cohort of 40 dogs using our toys and our methods for prediction is over \$70,000. With CCI's 6 training centers, annual savings could be upwards of \$5 million per year.},

Recent interest in the nascent field of Animal–Computer Interaction has prompted research in computer-mediated technology for communication between working dogs and their handlers. Haptic (touch) interfaces in the form of vibrating motors are a promising approach for handler-to-dog communication. Haptic interfaces can provide a silent, long-range method of sending commands to a dog, when voice or hand signals are inappropriate or impossible. However, evaluating haptic interfaces for dogs, who cannot self-report sensations, creates interesting challenges. This study draws on human–computer interaction concepts, such as Just Noticeable Difference, to explore methods and issues in evaluating haptic interfaces for working dogs. We created a haptic system and developed an evaluation method, reporting results for ten dogs of widely varying breeds, sizes, and coat types.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental issues in the study of animal cognition concerns categorization. Although domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are on the brink to become one of the model animals in animal psychology, their categorization abilities are unknown. This is probably largely due to the absence of an adequate method for testing dogs' ability to discriminate between large sets of pictures in the absence of human cueing. Here we present a computer-automated touch-screen testing procedure, which enabled us to test visual discrimination in dogs while social cueing was ruled out. Using a simultaneous discrimination procedure, we first trained dogs (N = 4) to differentiate between a set of dog pictures (N = 40) and an equally large set of landscape pictures. All subjects learned to discriminate between the two sets and showed successful transfer to novel pictures. Interestingly, presentation of pictures providing contradictive information (novel dog pictures mounted on familiar landscape pictures) did not disrupt performance, which suggests that the dogs made use of a category-based response rule with classification being coupled to category-relevant features (of the dog) rather than to item-specific features (of the background). We conclude that dogs are able to classify photographs of natural stimuli by means of a perceptual response rule using a newly established touch-screen procedure.},

	abstract = {The ability to reason by exclusion (which is defined as the selection of the correct alternative by logically excluding other potential alternatives; Call in Anim Cogn 9:393-403 2006) is well established in humans. Several studies have found it to be present in some nonhuman species as well, whereas it seems to be somewhat limited or even absent in others. As inconsistent methodology might have contributed to the revealed inter-species differences, we examined reasoning by exclusion in pigeons (n = 6), dogs (n = 6), students (n = 6), and children (n = 8) under almost equal experimental conditions. After being trained in a computer-controlled two-choice procedure to discriminate between four positive (S+) and four negative (S-) photographs, the subjects were tested with displays consisting of one S- and one of four novel stimuli (S'). One pigeon, half of the dogs and almost all humans preferred S' over S-, thereby choosing either by novelty, or by avoiding S- without acquiring any knowledge about S', or by inferring positive class membership of S' by excluding S-. To decide among these strategies the subjects that showed a preference for S' were then tested with displays consisting of one of the S' and one of four novel stimuli (S''). Although the pigeon preferentially chose the S'' and by novelty, dogs and humans maintained their preference for S', thereby showing evidence of reasoning by exclusion. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that none of the pigeons, but half of the dogs and almost all humans inferred positive class membership of S' by logically excluding S-.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Aged dogs suffer from reduced mobility and activity levels, which can affect their daily lives. It is quite typical for owners of older dogs to reduce all activities such as walking, playing and training, since their dog may appear to no longer need them. Previous studies have shown that ageing can be slowed by mental and physical stimulation, and thus stopping these activities might actually lead to faster ageing in dogs, which can result in a reduction in the quality of life of the animal, and may even decrease the strength of the dog-owner bond. In this paper, we describe in detail a touchscreen apparatus, software and training method that we have used to facilitate dog computer interaction (DCI). We propose that DCI has the potential to improve the welfare of older dogs in particular through cognitive enrichment. We provide hypotheses for future studies to examine the possible effects of touchscreen use on physiological, behavioural and cognitive measures of dogs' positive affect and well-being, and any impact on the dog-owner bond. In the future, collaborations between researchers in animal-computer interaction, dog trainers, and cognitive scientists are essential to develop the hardware and software necessary to realise the full potential of this training and enrichment tool.},

Fifty adult humans were tested with pictures showing a female experimenter pointing, gazing or glancing to the left or right side. Half of the pictures were shown after they were altered to a setting that approximated dog vision. Participants had difficulty to find out the direction of glancing when the pictures were in dog-vision mode. Glances in dog-vision setting were followed less correctly and with a slower response time than other cues. Our results are the first that show the visual performance of humans under circumstances that model how dogs’ weaker vision would affect their responses in an ethological experiment.

Rare examples of acoustic size modulation are due to specific features that enable the sender to steadily communicate exaggerated body size. However, one could argue that it would be more adaptive if senders could adjust their signaling behavior to the fighting potential of their actual opponent. So far there has been no experimental evidence for this possibility. We tested this hypothesis by exposing family dogs (Canis familiaris) to humans with potentially different fighting ability. In a within-subject experiment, 64 dogs of various breeds consecutively faced two threateningly approaching humans, either two men or two women of different stature, or a man and a woman of similar or different stature. We found that the dogs’ vocal responses were affected by the gender of the threatening stranger and the dog owner’s gender. Dogs with a female owner, or those dogs which came from a household where both genders were present, reacted with growls of lower values of the Pitch–Formant component (including deeper fundamental frequency and lower formant dispersion) to threatening men. Our results are the first to show that non-human animals react with dynamic alteration of acoustic parameters related to their individual indexical features (body size), depending on the level of threat in an agonistic encounter.},

Besides the obvious need for ethological research, both in the field and in the laboratory, the possible information content of barks can also be explored by computerized acoustic analyses. This study compares four different supervised learning methods (naive Bayes, classification trees, [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors and logistic regression) combined with three strategies for selecting variables (all variables, filter and wrapper feature subset selections) to classify Mudi dogs by sex, age, context and individual from their barks. The classification accuracy of the models obtained was estimated by means of [Formula: see text]-fold cross-validation. Percentages of correct classifications were 85.13 \% for determining sex, 80.25 \% for predicting age (recodified as young, adult and old), 55.50 \% for classifying contexts (seven situations) and 67.63 \% for recognizing individuals (8 dogs), so the results are encouraging. The best-performing method was [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors following a wrapper feature selection approach. The results for classifying contexts and recognizing individual dogs were better with this method than they were for other approaches reported in the specialized literature. This is the first time that the sex and age of domestic dogs have been predicted with the help of sound analysis. This study shows that dog barks carry ample information regarding the caller's indexical features. Our computerized analysis provides indirect proof that barks may serve as an important source of information for dogs as well.},

Humans use these structural rules to attribute emotions to dog vocalizations, especially to barks, which match with their contexts. In contrast, humans were found to be unable to differentiate between playful and threatening growls, probably because single growls’ aggression level was assessed based on acoustic size cues. To resolve this contradiction, we played back natural growl bouts from three social contexts (food guarding, threatening and playing) to humans, who had to rate the emotional load and guess the context of the playbacks. Listeners attributed emotions to growls according to their social contexts. Within threatening and playful contexts, bouts with shorter, slower pulsing growls and showing smaller apparent body size were rated to be less aggressive and fearful, but more playful and happy. Participants associated the correct contexts with the growls above chance. Moreover, women and participants experienced with dogs scored higher in this task. Our results indicate that dogs may communicate honestly their size and inner state in a serious contest situation, while manipulatively in more uncertain defensive and playful contexts.},

The olfactory experience of an untrained dog, by contrast, has not been well documented. In the current research we begin to remedy that by testing untrained pet dogs' olfactory perception of quantity. While previous research found that dogs could discriminate visible quantities of more or less food (Prato-Previde, Marshall-Pescini, \& Valsecchi, 2008), our results find that, by contrast, companion dogs do not reliably discriminate quantities when the food can be smelled but not seen. Sixty-one percent of dogs (39 of 64), given a choice between closed plates with one and five morsels of food, approached plates with the larger quantity: not significantly more than approached plates with the lesser quantity (binomial, p = .169). We did find that during dogs' initial investigation of both food amounts, subjects gave more attention to the plate containing the larger quantity (binomial, p{\textless} 0.001). In a second condition, we replicated, with closed plates, Prato-Previde et al.'s (2008) finding that owner interest in a plate holding a lesser quantity of food reliably leads dogs to approach that plate (binomial, p{\textless} 0.001). Though research has demonstrated dogs' preference for a larger amount of food (Ward \& Smuts, 2007), in a third condition testing the effect of adding a strong odor to a visibly larger food quantity, we found that the addition of odor often reversed that preference (44/69 dogs; p{\textless} .03). Finally, we consider the methodological implications of this work on future dog cognition studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In total, 12,964 calls were classified visually from spectrograms into five voiced (tonal) (whine, moo, cackle, growl and bark), and three unvoiced, or noisy (pant, snort and cough) call types. The classification results were verified with discriminant function analysis (DFA) and randomization. We found that the Aggressive and Unselected foxes produced the same call type sets toward humans, whereas the Tame foxes used distinctive vocalizations toward humans. The Tame and Aggressive foxes had significantly higher percentages of time spent vocalizing than the Unselected, in support of Cohen \& Fox (1976) hypothesis that domestication relaxes the selection pressure for silence, still acting in wild canids. Unlike in dogs, the "domesticated" Tame foxes did not show hypertrophied barking toward humans, using instead the cackle and pant. We conclude that the use of a certain call type for communication between humans and canids is species-specific, and not is the direct effect of domestication per se. ¬© 2008 AB Academic Publishers.},

In this sense, the combination of visual and auditory cues to categorize others' emotions facilitates the information processing and indicates high-level cognitive representations. Using a cross-modal preferential looking paradigm, we presented dogs with either human or dog faces with different emotional valences (happy/playful versus angry/aggressive) paired with a single vocalization from the same individual with either a positive or negative valence or Brownian noise. Dogs looked significantly longer at the face whose expression was congruent to the valence of vocalization, for both conspecifics and heterospecifics, an ability previously known only in humans. These results demonstrate that dogs can extract and integrate bimodal sensory emotional information, and discriminate between positive and negative emotions from both humans and dogs.},

We used a habituation–dishabituation paradigm for testing discriminatory abilities. Three 25-s long samples of “stranger” bark were followed by a single “alone” bark sample. As a control, we used two types of mechanical noise (an electric drill and a refrigerator). Dogs (n=14) were equipped with a portable heart rate monitor which recorded the data during the whole experiment. Upon hearing the first barking sound, the heart rate of the dogs increased significantly, followed by a habituation when the same barks were played back the second and third time. The fourth, different bark caused dishabituation of the heart rate. This suggests that heart rate can be a sensitive indicator of changes in attentiveness. The dogs did not show any significant evidence of dishabituation to the Control condition of the mechanical noises. Our experiment showed that dogs can perceive the difference between barks originating from different situations, thus barking is perhaps a communicative tool not only for dogs to humans, but for dogs to dogs as well.},

	abstract = {Besides being a widely investigated behavioural phenomenon, barks of dogs often represent a factor of nuisance for people. Although some argue that dog barking has no or only minimal communicative function, it was shown recently that these acoustic signals carry various information that humans can decipher. However, apart from a few laboratory studies, until now no targeted research has been done about the communicative role of barks in the intraspecific domain. In this field experiment companion dogs were tested with bark playbacks at home, in a suburban environment. From a hidden sound system, placed near to the gate outside of the property, each subject was exposed to pre-recorded barks of an unfamiliar and a familiar dog. Barks for the playbacks were recorded in two different contexts: when the dog was either left alone or when it was barking at a stranger at the fence. We found differences in the behaviour of dogs depending on both the familiarity and context of the playback barks. The position of the dogs (near the house or near the gate) was mainly influenced by the context of the barks (p=0.011), in a significant interaction with the familiarity of the barking dog (p=0.020). Subjects stayed at the gate (nearest to the source of the sound) the longest when they heard an unfamiliar dog barking at a stranger (padj=0.012). Meanwhile they stayed at the house mostly during the barks of a lonely unfamiliar dog (padj=0.001). Dogs oriented more towards the house (where the familiar dog stayed during the experiment) when they heard the familiar dog's barking (p=0.019). Subjects barked more often when they heard the ‘stranger’ barks, independently of the familiarity of the caller (p=0.035). As a conclusion, dogs seemingly distinguished among the callers based on familiarity and between the contexts of the barks. This is the first study on companion dogs in their natural environment that found evidence that dogs are able to extract detailed information from the barks. The relevance of our findings for the management of excessive bark is discussed.},

In this review, an ethological look is taken at the communicative aspect of dog barking. Emerging new research has indicated that in the repertoire of dog vocalisations barking has unique features in showing wide ranges of acoustic parameters, such as frequency, tonality and rhythmicity. Barking has been shown to be context dependent, and provides information for humans about the inner state of the dog although there are few indications that barking is used for intra-species communication. It is assumed that dog barking emerged through selective processes in which human preferences for certain acoustic aspects of the vocalisation may have been paramount. A more experiment-oriented approach is required for the study of dog vocalisation that could shed light on the possible communicative function of these acoustic signals.},

We describe two methods developed for the frequency analysis of a complex swift fox Vulpes uelox vocalisation, the barking sequence: (1) autocorrelation function analysis and (2) instantaneous frequency analysis. The autocorrelation function analysis results in an energy density spectrum of the signal's averaged amplitude and frequency information. This analysis was used for locating possible formant structures and quantifying the energy distribution of single barks in the barking sequence. The instantaneous frequency analysis is applied to individual continuous frequency bands and generates frequency contours with a resolution of a couple of Hertz. It was used to quantify frequency modulation and calculate average frequencies of harmonic bands in individual barks and to estimate fundamental frequencies. This second method of analysis had to be evaluated with spectrographic analysis to gauge its reliability for each band analysed. The algorithms used should make both of these methods applicable to other complex vocalisations. Keywords:},

	abstract = {Canine vocalizations can be divided into several types and these types of vocalizations can carry the senders' emotional state to receivers such as other dogs and humans. When humans send a signal consisting of short notes, it can elicit a reactive response and increase motor activity levels more so than a signal consisting of a longer continuous note. This means that humans and dogs can communicate with each other using acoustic signals. These canine vocalizations can be analyzed by computer-aided programs that evaluate several parameters including fundamental frequency, and other frequency variables like minimum and maximum frequency, duration of call, inter-call duration, amplitude variables, harmonic to noise ratio (HNR), nonlinear phenomena, like limit cycle, subharmonic, biphonation, and chaos. Dogs' vocalizations can be analyzed using objective scientific criteria with these parameters, and using this analysis, we know that dog vocalizations fall into several context based vocal types. Also humans can distinguish the difference in dog barks. The dogs' barking can be a behavioral problem because of their high intensity especially in urban areas. Treatment methods may include environmental manipulation, behavior modification, and positive re-enforcement.

	abstract = {Barking in domestic dogs still remains a topic of controversial discussions. While some authors assess dog- barking an acoustic means of expression becoming more and more sophisticated during domestication, others name this sound type "non-communicative". Vocal repertoires as works on individual sound types are rare, however, and there has been almost no work done on Iow-intensity, close-range vocalizations, yet such types of vocalization are especially important with the more social canids, hence, with the human-dog-communication and understanding of dogs. Most of the investigations published so far are based on auditive sound impressions and lack objectivity. The principal method used in this study was sonagraphic. This facilitates the identiftcation of sounds and reveales, whether subjective Classification can be verified by objectively measured parameters. Finally, meanings, funetions and emotions were examined for all the major sounds described and are discussed in terms of relationships between sound structure and Signal function, signal emission and social context as behavioural response, and overlapping Channels of communication. Ontogeny of acoustic communication in 11 European wolves has been compared to various dog breeds (8 Standard Poodles, 8 Toy Poodles, 15 Kleine Münsterländer, 11 Weimaraner Hunting Dogs, 16 Tervueren, 12 American Staffordshire Terriers, and 13 German Shepherds, 12 Alaskan Malamutes, and 9 Bull Terriers) from birth up to 8 (12) weeks resp. 4 (12) months of age. Noisy and harmonic sound groups were analysed separately as overriding units. Following parameters were used: fmax=maximum of spectrographic pietured sounds (Hz), xfo=mean of the lowest frequency band of harmonic sounds (Hz), xfd=mean of the frequency of strongest amplitude of noisy sounds (Hz), delta f=frequency ränge of sounds (Hz), duration of sounds (ms). Statistical analysis was run on "Statistica", Release 4,0. Within the sound type barking 2 to 12 subunits were classified in the different breeds, aecording to their context-speeifie spectrographic design, and behavioural responses. Categories of function / emotion include f.e. social play, play soliticing, exploration, caregiving, social contact and "greeting", loneliness, and agonistc behaviours. "Interaction" was the most common category of social context for masted barkings (56\% of oecurences). Especially close-range vocalizations, conceming the major sound type of most domestic dogs, the bark, evolved highly variable. However, the ecological niche of domestic dogs is highly variable, just as the individual differences in the dogs are, which seem to be breed-typical to a great extent. Thus, complexity within the dog's vocal repertoire, and therefore enhancement of its communicative value, is achieved by many subunits of bark, some standing for specific motivations, informations and expressions. Complexity within the dogs'vocal repertoire is extended by the use of mixed sounds in the barking context. Transitions and gradations to a great extend oeeur via bark sounds: harmonic, intermediate and noisy subunits.},

However, this particular function of communicative interaction has not previously been found in canids. We provide the first experimental indication that domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, rely on context-dependent signals during interspecific agonistic encounters. We recorded several sequences of growls from dogs in three different contexts: during play, guarding a bone from another dog, and reacting to a threatening stranger. We analysed the acoustic structure of the growls and additionally performed playback tests in a seminatural food-guarding situation. We found that play growls differed acoustically from the other two (agonistic) types of growls, mainly in their fundamental frequencies and formant dispersions. Results of the playback experiment showed that food-guarding growls deterred other dogs from taking away a seemingly unattended bone more effectively than growls recorded in the threatening stranger situation. We ruled out an effect of the signaller's body weight on the subjects' responses. These results provide the first evidence of context specificity of agonistic vocalizations in the dog. We discuss the possible aspects of honesty and deception through acoustic modulation of growls. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In recent software packages for the analysis of acoustic signals, procedures are integrated which allow the calculation of a variety of signal features. However, these algorithms are often problematic under the conditions mentioned above. In this paper, we present a multi-parametric approach which reduces these problems and which allows a quantitative and reproducible analysis of complex animal vocalisations. Our approach comprises the following aspects: (1) reduction of influences of recording conditions, (2) determination of different sound features and (3) calculation of parameters to characterize these sound features. All calculations are done on the basis of the digitized spectrograms. Special attention is given to the use of smoothing algorithms and dynamic thresholds in order to estimate sound features and to reduce influences resulting from recording conditions.

Domestication and selective breeding have resulted in a high variability in head size and shape in the dog (Canis familiaris), suggesting that there might be large differences in the vocal tract length, which could cause formant behaviour to affect interbreed communication. Lateral radiographs were made of dogs from several breeds ranging in size from a Yorkshire terrier (2.5 kg) to a German shepherd (50 kg) and were used to measure vocal tract length. In addition, we recorded an acoustic signal (growling) from some dogs. Significant correlations were found between vocal tract length, body mass and formant dispersion, suggesting that formant dispersion can deliver information about the body size of the vocalizer. Because of the low correlation between vocal tract length and the first formant, we predict a non-uniform vocal tract shape.},

We recorded barking from 10 adult dogs, Canis familiaris, of six breeds in three different test situations: (1) a disturbance situation in which a stranger rang the doorbell, (2) an isolation situation in which the dog was locked outside or in a room isolated from its owner and (3) a play situation in which either two dogs or a human and a dog played together. We analysed spectrograms of 4672 barks using macros that took 60 sequential frequency measurements and 60 sequential amplitude measurements along the length of the call. Statistical analyses revealed that barks are graded vocalizations that range from harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated calls to harmonically rich, higher-frequency, modulated calls. The harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated barks were more commonly given in the disturbance situation, and the more tonal, higher-pitch, modulated barks were more commonly given in the isolation and play situations. Disturbance barks were also longer in duration with more rapid repetition than the barks given in other contexts. Discriminant analysis revealed that dog barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context even within individual dogs, and that dogs can be identified by their bark spectrograms despite the context of the bark. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

	abstract = {Barking is most often associated with the domestic dog Canis familiaris, but it is a common mammalian and avian vocalization. Like any vocalization, the acoustic character of the bark is likely to be a product of adaptation as well as an expression of the signaler's internal motivational state. While most authors recognize that the bark is a distinct signal type, no consistent description of its acoustic definition or function is apparent. The bark exhibits considerable variability in its acoustic form and occurs in a wide range of behavioral contexts, particularly in dogs. This has led some authors to suggest that dog barking might be a form of referential signaling, or an adaptation for heightened capability to communicate with humans. In this paper we propose a general ‘canonical’ acoustic description of the bark. Surveying relevant literature on dogs, wild canids, other mammals and birds, we explore an alternative functional hypothesis, first suggested by [Morton, E.S., 1977. On the occurrence and significance of motivation-structural rules in some bird and mammal sounds. Am. Nat. 111, 855–869] and consistent with his motivational-structural rules theory: that barking in many animals, including the domestic dog, is associated with mobbing behavior and the motivational states that accompany mobbing.},
