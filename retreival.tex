\section{Retrieval}
The mechanism for document retrieval is straightforward. A text query of the sound the user wants to retrieve is entered and a ranked list of documents is returned from the database. The rankings are given by the probability of a document belonging to the queried class. This has benefits over executing discrete predictions and returning the result as the probability is an analog for the confidence of a sound object existing in documents. This means that the results to some rank k will have a high confidence of containing the object. In the future, natural language processing will be applied to the queries to allow queries to be natural.
