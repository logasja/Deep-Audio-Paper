\section{Future Work}

The hierarchical approach in its current iteration only provides minimal
improvement over standard DNNs. However, the lessons learned here provide a
basis on which to build out a more performant system. First, representation will
be revisited and recurrent neural networks will be employed to aid in creating a
new representation that considers audio's temporal nature. Second, more specific
probabilistic neural networks will be investigated for integration into the
\textit{Animal Voices} and \textit{Interacting Materials} classification tasks.
Finally, a querying front-end will be developed for this and will be used for
querying of the AudioSet database.
